  <h2 class='c004'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The following Studies are not a complete treatise
on child-psychology, but merely deal with certain
aspects of children’s minds which happen to have
come under my notice, and to have had a special
interest for me. In preparing them I have tried to
combine with the needed measure of exactness a
manner of presentation which should attract other
readers than students of psychology, more particularly
parents and young teachers.</p>

<p class='c001'>A part of these Studies has already appeared
elsewhere. The Introductory Chapter was published
in the <cite>Fortnightly Review</cite> for November, 1895.
The substance of those from II. to VIII. has been
printed in the <cite>Popular Science Monthly</cite> of New
York. Portions of the “Extracts from a Father’s
Diary” appeared in the form of two essays, one on
“Babies and Science” in the <cite>Cornhill Magazine</cite> in
1881, and the other on “Baby Linguistics” in the
<cite>English Illustrated Magazine</cite> in 1884. The original
form of these, involving a certain disguise—though
hardly one of impenetrable thickness—has been retained.
The greater part of the study on “George
Sand’s Childhood” was published as two articles in
<cite>Longmans’ Magazine</cite> in 1889 and 1890.</p>

<p class='c001'>Like all others who have recently worked at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>child-psychology I am much indebted to the pioneers
in the field, more particularly to Professor W.
Preyer. In addition to these I wish to express my
obligations to my colleague, Dr. Postgate, of Trinity
College, Cambridge, for kindly reading through my
essay on children’s language, and giving me many
valuable suggestions; to Lieutenant-General Pitt
Rivers, F.R.S., and Mr. H. Balfour, of the Museum,
Oxford, for the friendly help they rendered me in
studying the drawings of savages, and to Mr. E.
Cooke for many valuable facts and suggestions
bearing on children’s modes of drawing. Lastly, I
would tender my warm acknowledgments to the
parents who have sent me notes on their children’s
mental development. To some few of these sets of
observations, drawn up with admirable care, I feel
peculiarly indebted, for without them I should probably
not have written my book.</p>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_1'>1</span>STUDIES OF CHILDHOOD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c004'>I. <br /> INTRODUCTORY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>Man has always had the child with him, and one might
be sure that since he became gentle and alive to the
beauty of things he must have come under the spell of
the baby. We have evidence beyond the oft-quoted departure
of Hector and other pictures of childish grace in
early literature that baby-worship and baby-subjection
are not wholly things of modern times. There is a pretty
story taken down by Mr. Leland from the lips of an old
Indian woman, which relates how Glooskap the hero-god,
after conquering all his enemies, rashly tried his
hand at managing a certain mighty baby, Wasis by
name, and how he got punished for his rashness.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c011'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Yet there is good reason to suppose that it is only
within comparatively recent times that the more subtle
charm and the deeper significance of infancy have been
discerned. We have come to appreciate babyhood as
we have come to appreciate the finer lineaments of nature
as a whole. This applies, of course, more especially
to the ruder sex. The man has in him much of the boy’s
contempt for small things, and he needed ages of education
at the hands of the better-informed woman before
he could perceive the charm of infantile ways.</p>

<p class='c001'>One of the first males to do justice to this attractive
subject was Rousseau. He made short work with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>theological dogma that the child is born morally depraved,
and can only be made good by miraculous appliances.
His watchword, return to nature, included a
reversion to the infant as coming virginal and unspoilt
by man’s tinkering from the hands of its Maker. To
gain a glimpse of this primordial beauty before it was
marred by man’s awkward touch was something, and so
Rousseau set men in the way of sitting reverently at the
feet of infancy, watching and learning.</p>

<p class='c001'>For us of to-day, who have learned to go to the pure
springs of nature for much of our spiritual refreshment, the
child has acquired a high place among the things of beauty.
Indeed, the grace of childhood may almost be said to have
been discovered by the modern poet. Wordsworth has
stooped over his cradle intent on catching, ere they passed,
the ‘visionary gleams’ of ‘the glories he hath known’.
Blake, R. L. Stevenson, and others, have tried to put
into language his day-dreamings, his quaint fancyings.
Dickens and Victor Hugo have shown us something of his
delicate quivering heart-strings; Swinburne has summed
up the divine charm of “children’s ways and wiles”.
The page of modern literature is, indeed, a monument
of our child-love and our child-admiration.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor is it merely as to a pure untarnished nature that
we go back admiringly to childhood. The æsthetic charm
of the infant which draws us so potently to its side and
compels us to watch its words and actions is, like everything
else which moves the modern mind, highly complex.
Among other sources of this charm we may discern the
perfect serenity, the happy ‘insouciance’ of the childish
mind. The note of world-complaint in modern life has
penetrated into most domains, yet it has not, one would
hope, penetrated into the charmed circle of childish experience.
Childhood has, no doubt, its sad aspect:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Poor stumbler on the rocky coast of woe,</div>
      <div class='line'>Tutored by pain each source of pain to know:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>neglect and cruelty may bring much misery into the first
bright years. Yet the very instinct of childhood to be glad
in its self-created world, an instinct which with consummate
art Victor Hugo keeps warm and quick in the breast
of the half-starved ill-used child Cosette, secures for it a
peculiar blessedness. The true nature-child, who has not
become <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>blasé</i></span>, is happy, untroubled with the future, knowing
nothing of the misery of disillusion. As, with hearts
chastened by many experiences, we take a peep over the
wall of his fancy-built pleasance, we seem to be taken back
to a real golden age. With Amiel, we say: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Le peu de
paradis que nous aperçevons encore sur la terre est du à
sa présence”.</span> Yet the thought, which the same moment
brings, of the flitting of the nursery visions, of the coming
storm and stress, adds a pathos to the spectacle, and we
feel as Heine felt when he wrote:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ich schau’ dich an, und Wehmuth</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Schleicht mir ins Herz hinein.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Other and strangely unlike feelings mingle with this
caressing, half-pitiful admiration. We moderns are given
to relieving the strained attitude of reverence and pity by
momentary outbursts of humorous merriment. The child,
while appealing to our admiration and our pity, makes a
large and many-voiced appeal also to our sense of the
laughter in things. It is indeed hard to say whether he is
most amusing when setting at naught in his quiet, lordly
way, our most extolled views, our ideas of what is true
and false, of the proper uses of things, and so forth, or
when labouring in his perfectly self-conceived fashion to
overtake us and be as experienced and as conventional
as ourselves. This ever new play of droll feature in
childish thought and action forms one of the deepest
sources of delight for the modern lover of childhood.</p>

<p class='c001'>With the growth of a poetic or sentimental interest in
childhood there has come a new and different kind of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>interest. Ours is a scientific age, and science has cast its
inquisitive eye on the infant. We want to know what
happens in these first all-decisive two or three years of
human life, by what steps exactly the wee amorphous
thing takes shape and bulk, both physically and mentally.
And we can now speak of the beginning of a careful and
methodical investigation of child-nature, by men trained
in scientific observation. This line of inquiry, started by
physicians, as the German Sigismund, in connection with
their special professional aims, has been carried on by a
number of fathers and others having access to the infant,
among whom it may be enough to name Darwin and
Preyer. A fuller list of writings on the subject will be
given at the end of the volume.</p>

<p class='c001'>This eagerness to know what the child is like, an eagerness
illustrated further by the number of reminiscences of
early years recently published, is the outcome of a many-sided
interest which it may be worth while to analyse.</p>

<p class='c001'>The most obvious source of interest in the doings of
infancy lies in its primitiveness. At the cradle we are
watching the beginnings of things, the first tentative
thrustings forward into life. Our modern science is before
all things historical and genetic, going back to beginnings
so as to understand the later and more complex
phases of things as the outcome of these beginnings. The
same kind of curiosity which prompts the geologist to
get back to the first stages in the building up of the
planet, or the biologist to search out the pristine forms
of life, is beginning to urge the student of man to discover
by a careful study of infancy the way in which
human life begins to take its characteristic forms.</p>

<p class='c001'>The appearance of Darwin’s name among those who
have deemed the child worthy of study suggests that the
subject is closely connected with natural history. However
man in his proud maturity may be related to Nature,
it is certain that in his humble inception he is immersed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>in Nature and saturated with her. As we all know, the
lowest races of mankind stand in close proximity to the
animal world. The same is true of the infants of civilised
races. Their life is outward and visible, forming a
part of nature’s spectacle; reason and will, the noble
prerogatives of humanity, are scarce discernible; sense,
appetite, instinct, these animal functions seem to sum up
the first year of human life.</p>

<p class='c001'>To the evolutionist, moreover, the infant exhibits a still
closer kinship to the natural world. In the successive
stages of fœtal development he sees the gradual unfolding
of human lineaments out of a widely typical animal form.
And even after birth he can discern new evidences of this
genealogical relation of the “lord” of creation to his
inferiors. How significant, for example, is the fact recently
established by a medical man, Dr. Louis Robinson,
that the new-born infant is able just like the ape to suspend
his whole weight by grasping a small horizontal rod.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c011'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Yet even as nature-object for the biologist the child
presents distinctive attributes. Though sharing in animal
instinct, he shares in it only to a very small extent. The
most striking characteristic of the new-born offspring of
man is its unpreparedness for life. Compare with the
young of other animals the infant so feeble and incapable.
He can neither use his limbs nor see the distance of
objects as a new-born chick or calf is able to do. His
brain-centres are, we are told, in a pitiable state of undevelopment—and
are not even securely encased within
their bony covering. Indeed, he resembles for all the
world a public building which has to be opened by a
given date, and is found when the day arrives to be in a
humiliating state of incompleteness.</p>

<p class='c001'>This fact of the special helplessness of the human offspring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>at birth, of its long period of dependence on parental
or other aids—a period which, probably, tends to
grow longer as civilisation advances—is rich in biological
and sociological significance. For one thing, it presupposes
a specially high development of the protective and
fostering instincts in the human parents, and particularly
the mother—for if the helpless wee thing were not met by
these instincts, what would become of our race? It is probable,
too, as Mr. Spencer and others have argued, that the
institution by nature of this condition of infantile weakness
has reacted on the social affections of the race, helping to
develop our pitifulness for all frail and helpless things.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor is this all. The existence of the infant, with its
large and imperative claims, has been a fact of capital
importance in the development of social customs. Ethnological
researches show that communities have been much
exercised with the problem of infancy, have paid it the
homage due to its supreme sacredness, girding it about
with a whole group of protective and beneficent customs.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c011'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Enough has been said, perhaps, to show the far-reaching
significance of babyhood to the modern savant. It is
hardly too much to say that it has become one of the most
eloquent of nature’s phenomena, telling us at once of our
affinity to the animal world, and of the forces by which
our race has, little by little, lifted itself to so exalted a
position above this world; and so it has happened that
not merely to the perennial baby-worshipper, the mother,
and not merely to the poet touched with the mystery of
far-off things, but to the grave man of science the infant
has become a centre of lively interest.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nevertheless, it is not to the mere naturalist that the
babe reveals all its significance. Physical organism as it
seems to be more than anything else, hardly more than a
vegetative thing indeed, it carries with it the germ of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>human consciousness, and this consciousness begins to
expand and to form itself into a truly human shape from
the very beginning. And here a new source of interest
presents itself. It is the human psychologist, the student
of those impalpable, unseizable, evanescent phenomena
which we call “state of <a id='corr7.6'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='conscionsness'>consciousness</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_7.6'><ins class='correction' title='conscionsness'>consciousness</ins></a></span>,” who has a supreme
interest, and a scientific property in these first
years of a human existence. What is of most account
in these crude tentatives at living after the human fashion
is the play of mind, the first spontaneous manifestations
of recognition, of reasoning expectation, of feelings
of sympathy and antipathy, of definite persistent purpose.</p>

<p class='c001'>Rude, inchoate, vague enough, no doubt, are these first
groping movements of a human mind: yet of supreme
value to the psychologist just because they are the first.
If, reflects the psychologist, he can only get at this baby’s
consciousness so as to understand what is passing there,
he will be in an infinitely better position to find his way
through the intricacies of the adult consciousness. It may
be, as we shall see by-and-by, that the baby’s mind is not
so perfectly simple, so absolutely primitive as it at first
looks. Yet it is the simplest type of human consciousness
to which we can have access. The investigator of this
consciousness can never take any known sample of the
animal mind as his starting point if for no other reason
for this, that while possessing many of the elements of the
human mind, it presents these in so unlike, so peculiar a
pattern.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this genetic tracing back of the complexities of
man’s mental life to their primitive elements in the child’s
consciousness, questions of peculiar interest will arise.
A problem which though having a venerable antiquity is
still full of meaning concerns the precise relation of the
higher forms of intelligence and of sentiment to the elementary
facts of the individual’s life-experience. Are
we to regard all our ideas, even those of God, as woven by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>the mind out of its experiences, as Locke thought, or have
we certain ‘innate ideas’ from the first? Locke thought
he could settle this point by observing children. To-day,
when the philosophic emphasis is laid not on the date of
appearance of the ‘innate’ intuition, but on its originality
and spontaneity, this method of interrogating the child’s
mind may seem less promising. Yet if of less philosophical
importance than was once supposed, it is of great
psychological importance. There are certain questions,
such as that of how we come to see things at a distance
from us, which can be approached most advantageously
by a study of infant movements. In like manner I believe
the growth of a moral sentiment, of that feeling of reverence
for duty to which Kant gave so eloquent an expression,
can only be understood by the most painstaking
observation of the mental activities of the first years.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is, however, another, and in a sense a larger,
source of psychological interest in studying the processes
and development of the infant mind. It was pointed out
above that to the evolutional biologist the child exhibits
man in his kinship to the lower sentient world. This
same evolutional point of view enables the psychologist
to connect the unfolding of an infant’s mind with something
which has gone before, with the mental history of
the race. According to this way of looking at infancy
the successive phases of its mental life are a brief <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>resumé</i></span>
of the more important features in the slow upward progress
of the species. The periods dominated successively
by sense and appetite, by blind wondering and superstitious
fancy, and by a calmer observation and a juster
reasoning about things, these steps mark the pathway
both of the child-mind and of the race-mind.</p>

<p class='c001'>This being so, the first years of a child, with their imperfect
verbal expression, their crude fanciful ideas, their
seizures by rage and terror, their absorption in the present
moment, acquire a new and antiquarian interest. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>mirror for us, in a diminished distorted reflection no
doubt, the probable condition of primitive man. As Sir
John Lubbock and other anthropologists have told us,
the intellectual and moral resemblances between the lowest
existing races of mankind and children are numerous
and close. They will be illustrated again and again in
the following studies.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet this way of viewing childhood is not merely of
antiquarian interest. While a monument of his race, and
in a manner a key to its history, the child is also its product.
In spite of the fashionable Weismannism of the
hour, there are evolutionists who hold that in the early
manifested tendencies of the child, we can discern signs
of a hereditary transmission of the effects of ancestral experiences
and activities. His first manifestations of rage,
for example, are a survival of actions of remote ancestors
in their life and death struggles. The impulse of obedience,
which is as much a characteristic of the child as that
of disobedience, may in like manner be regarded as a
transmitted rudiment of a long practised action of socialised
ancestors. This idea of an increment of intelligence
and moral disposition, earned for the individual not by
himself but by his ancestors, has its peculiar interest. It
gives a new meaning to human progress to suppose that
the dawn of infant intelligence, instead of being a return
to a primitive darkness, contains from the first a faint light
reflected on it from the lamp of racial intelligence which
has preceded that instead of a return to the race’s starting
point, the lowest form of the school of experience, it is a
start in a higher form, the promotion being a reward conferred
on the child for the exertions of his ancestors.
Psychological observation will be well employed in scanning
the features of the infant’s mind in order to see
whether they yield evidence of such ancestral dowering.</p>

<p class='c001'>So much with respect to the rich and varied scientific
interest attaching to the movements of the child’s mind.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>It only remains to touch on a third main interest in childhood,
the practical or educational interest. The modern
world, while erecting the child into an object of æsthetic
contemplation, while bringing to bear on him the bull’s
eye lamp of scientific observation, has become sorely
troubled by the momentous problem of rearing him.
What was once a matter of instinct and unthinking rule-of-thumb
has become the subject of profound and perplexing
discussion. Mothers—the right sort of mothers that
is—feel that they must know <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>au fond</i></span> this wee speechless
creature which they are called upon to direct into the safe
road to manhood. And professional teachers, more particularly
the beginners in the work of training, whose
work is in some respects the most difficult and the most
honourable, have come to see that a clear insight into
child-nature and its spontaneous movements, must precede
any intelligent attempt to work beneficially upon
this nature. In this way the teacher has lent his support
to the savant and the psychologist in their investigation
of infancy. More particularly he has betaken him to the
psychologist in order to discover more of the native tendencies
and the governing laws of that unformed child-mind
which it is his in a special manner to form. In addition
to this, the growing educational interest in the spontaneous
behaviour of the child’s mind may be expected
to issue in a demand for a <em>statistic</em> of childhood, that is to
say, carefully arranged collections of observations bearing
on such points as children’s questions, their first thoughts
about nature, their manifestations of sensibility and insensibility.</p>

<p class='c001'>The awakening in the modern mind of this keen and
varied interest in childhood has led, and is destined to
lead still more, to the observation of infantile ways. This
observation will, of course, be of very different value according
as it subserves the contemplation of the humorous
or other æsthetically valuable aspect of child-nature,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>or as it is directed towards a scientific understanding of
this. Pretty anecdotes of children which tickle the emotions
may or may not add to our insight into the peculiar
mechanism of children’s minds. There is no necessary
connection between smiling at infantile drolleries and
understanding the laws of infantile intelligence. Indeed,
the mood of merriment, if too exuberant, will pretty
certainly swamp for the moment any desire to understand.</p>

<p class='c001'>The observation which is to further understanding,
which is to be acceptable to science, must itself be scientific.
That is to say, it must be at once guided by
foreknowledge, specially directed to what is essential in
a phenomenon and its surroundings or conditions, and
perfectly exact. If anybody supposes this to be easy,
he should first try his hand at the work, and then compare
what he has seen with what Darwin or Preyer has
been able to discover.</p>

<p class='c001'>How difficult this is may be seen even with reference
to the outward physical part of the phenomena to be
observed. Ask any mother untrained in observation to
note the first appearance of that complex facial movement
which we call a smile, and you know what kind of result
you are likely to get. The phenomena of a child’s mental
life, even on its physical and visible side, are of so
subtle and fugitive a character that only a fine and quick
observation is able to cope with them. But observation
of children is never merely seeing. Even the smile has
to be interpreted as a smile by a process of imaginative
inference. Many careless onlookers would say that a
baby smiles in the first days from very happiness, when
another and simpler explanation of the movement is forthcoming.
Similarly, it wants much fine judgment to say
whether an infant is merely stumbling accidentally on an
articulate sound, or is imitating your sound. A glance at
some of the best memoirs will show how enormously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>difficult it is to be sure of a right interpretation of these
early and comparatively simple manifestations of mind.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c011'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Things grow a great deal worse when we try to throw
our scientific lassoo about the elusive spirit of a child of
four or six, and to catch the exact meaning of its swiftly
changing movements. Children are, no doubt, at this age
frank before the eye of love, and their minds are vastly
more accessible than that of the dumb dog that can only
look his ardent thoughts. Yet they are by no means
so open to view as is often supposed. All kinds of shy
reticences hamper them: they feel unskilled in using
our cumbrous language; they soon find out that their
thoughts are not as ours, but often make us laugh. And
how carefully are they wont to hide from our sight their
nameless terrors, physical and moral. Much of the
deeper childish experience can only reach us, if at all,
years after it is over, through the faulty medium of adult
memory—faulty even when it is the memory of a Goethe,
a George Sand, a Robert Louis Stevenson.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c011'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Even when there is perfect candour, and the little one
does his best to instruct us as to what is passing in his
mind by his ‘whys’ and his ‘I ’sposes,’ accompanied by
the most eloquent of looks, we find ourselves ever and
again unequal to comprehending. Child-thought follows
its own paths—roads, as Mr. Rudyard Kipling has well
said, “unknown to those who have left childhood behind”.
The dark sayings of childhood, as when a child
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>asks, ‘Why am I not somebody else?’ will be fully illustrated
below.</p>

<p class='c001'>This being so, it might well seem arrogant to speak of
any ‘scientific’ investigation of the child’s mind; and, to
be candid, I may as well confess that, in spite of some
recently published highly hopeful forecasts of what child-psychology
is going to do for us, I think we are a long
way off from a perfectly scientific account of it. Our so-called
theories of children’s mental activity has so often
been hasty generalisations from imperfect observation.
Children are probably much more diverse in their ways
of thinking and feeling than our theories suppose. But
of this more presently. Even where we meet with a common
and comparatively prominent trait, we are far as yet
from having a perfect comprehension of it. I at least
believe that children’s play, about which so much has
confidently been written, is but imperfectly understood.
Is it serious business, half-conscious make-believe, more
than half-conscious acting, or, no one of these, or all of
them by turns? I think he would be a bold man who
ventured to answer this question straight away.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this state of things it might seem well to wait.
Possibly by-and-by we shall light on new methods of
tapping the childish consciousness. Patients in a certain
stage of the hypnotic trance have returned, it is said, to
their childish experience and feelings. Some people do
this, or appear to do this, in their dreams. I know a
young man who revives vivid recollections of the experiences
of the third year of life when he is sleepy, and
more especially if he is suffering from a cold. These
facts suggest that if we only knew more about the mode
of working of the brain we might reinstate a special
group of conditions which would secure a re-emergence
of childish ideas and sentiments.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet our case is not so hopeless that we need defer inquiry
into the child’s mind until human science has fathomed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>all the mysteries of the brain. We can know many
things of this mind, and these of great importance, even
now. The naturalist discusses the actions of the lower
animals, confidently attributing intelligent planning here,
and a germ of vanity or even of moral sense there; and
it would be hard were we forbidden to study the little
people that are of our own race, and are a thousand
times more open to inspection. Really good work has
already been done here, and one should be grateful. At
the same time, it seems to me of the greatest importance
to recognise that it is but a beginning: that the child
which the modern world has in the main discovered is
after all only half discovered: that if we are to get at his
inner life, his playful conceits, his solemn broodings over
the mysteries of things, his way of responding to the
motley show of life, we must carry this work of noting
and interpreting to a much higher point.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, if progress is to be made in this work, we must
have specially qualified workers. All who know anything
of the gross misunderstandings of children of which many
so-called intelligent adults are capable, will bear me out
when I say that a certain gift of penetration is absolutely
indispensable here. If any one asks me what the qualifications
of a good child-observer amount to, I may perhaps
answer, for the sake of brevity, ‘a divining faculty,
the offspring of child-love, perfected by scientific training’.
Let us see what this includes.</p>

<p class='c001'>That the observer of children must be a diviner, a sort
of clairvoyant reader of their secret thoughts, seems to me
perfectly obvious. Watch half a dozen men who find
themselves unexpectedly ushered into a room tenanted
by a small child, and you will soon be able to distinguish
the diviners, who, just because they have in themselves
something akin to the child, seem able at once to get
into touch with children. It is probable that women’s
acknowledged superiority in knowledge of child-nature is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>owing to their higher gift of sympathetic insight. This
faculty, so far from being purely intellectual, is very
largely the outgrowth of a peculiar moral nature to
which the life of all small things, and of children more
than all, is always sweet and congenial. It is very much
of a secondary, or acquired instinct; that is, an unreflecting
intuition which is the outgrowth of a large experience.
For the child-lover seeks the object of his love, and
is never so happy as when associating with children and
sharing in their thoughts and their pleasures. And it is
through such habitual intercourse that there forms itself
the instinct or tact by which the significance of childish
manifestation is at once unerringly discerned.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is in this tact or fineness of spiritual touch one
constituent so important as to deserve special mention. I
mean a lively memory of one’s own childhood. As I have
observed above, I do not believe in an exact and trustworthy
reproduction in later life of particular incidents of
childhood. All recalling of past experiences illustrates the
modifying influence of the later self in its attempt to assimilate
and understand the past self; and this transforming
effect is at its maximum when we try to get back to
childhood. But though our memory of childhood is not
in itself exact enough to furnish facts, it may be sufficiently
strong for the purposes of interpreting our observations
of the children we see about us. It is said, and said rightly,
that in order to read a child’s mind we need imagination,
and since all imagination is merely readjustment of individual
experience, it follows that the skilled decipherer
of infantile characters needs before all things to be in touch
with his own early feelings and thoughts. And this is
just what we find. The vivacious, genial woman who is
never so much at home as when surrounded by a bevy of
eager-minded children is a woman who remains young in
the important sense that she retains much of the freshness
and unconventionality of mind, much of the gaiety and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>expansiveness of early life. Conversely one may feel
pretty sure that a woman who retains a vivid memory of
her childish ideas and feelings will be drawn to the companionship
of children. After reading their autobiographies
one hardly needs to be told that Goethe carried
into old age his quick responsiveness to the gaiety of the
young heart; and that George Sand when grown old
was never so happy as when gathering the youngsters
about her.<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c011'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Yet valuable as is this gift of sympathetic insight, it
will not, of course, conduce to that methodical, exact
kind of observation which is required by science. Hence
the need of the second qualification: psychological training.
By this is meant that special knowledge which
comes from studying the principles of the science, its
peculiar problems, and the methods appropriate to these,
together with the special skill which is attained by a
methodical, practical application of this knowledge in the
actual observation and interpretation of manifestations of
mind. Thus a woman who wishes to observe to good
effect the mind of a child of three must have a sufficient
acquaintance with the general course of the mental life to
know what to expect, and in what way the phenomena
observed have to be interpreted. Really fine and fruitful
observation is the outcome of a large knowledge, and anybody
who is to carry out in a scientific fashion the observation
of the humblest phase of a child’s mental life must
already know this life as a whole, so far as psychology
can as yet describe its characteristics, and determine the
conditions of its activity.</p>

<p class='c001'>And here the question naturally arises: “Who is to
carry out this new line of scientific observation?” To
begin with the first stage of it, who is to carry out the exact
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>methodical record of the movements of the infant?
It is evident that qualification or capacity is not all that is
necessary here; capacity must be favoured with opportunity
before the work can be actually begun.</p>

<p class='c001'>It has been pointed out that the pioneers who struck
out this new line of experimental research were medical
men. The meaning of this fact is pretty apparent. The
doctor has not only a turn for scientific observation: he
is a privileged person in the nursery. The natural
guardians of infancy, the mother and the nurse, exempt
him from their general ban on the male. He excepted,
no man, not even the child’s own father, is allowed to
meddle too much with that divine mystery, that meeting
point of all the graces and all the beatitudes, the infant.</p>

<p class='c001'>Consider for a moment the natural prejudice which
the inquirer into the characteristics of the infant has to
face. Such inquiry is not merely passively watching what
spontaneously presents itself; it is emphatically experimenting,
that is, the calling out of reactions by applying
appropriate stimuli. Even to try whether the new-born
babe will close its fingers on your finger when brought
into contact with their anterior surface may well seem
impious to a properly constituted nurse. To propose to
test the wee creature’s sense of taste by applying drops
of various solutions, as acid, bitters, etc., to the tongue,
or to provoke ocular movements to the right or the left,
would pretty certainly seem a profanation of the temple
of infancy, if not fraught with danger to its tiny deity.
And as to trying Dr. Robinson’s experiment of getting
the newly arrived visitor to suspend his whole precious
weight by clasping a bar, it is pretty certain that, women
being constituted as at present, only a medical man could
have dreamt of so daring a feat.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is no doubt that baby-worship, the sentimental
adoration of infant ways, is highly inimical to the carrying
out of a perfectly cool and impartial process of scientific
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>observation. Hence the average mother can hardly be
expected to do more than barely to tolerate this encroaching
of experiment into the hallowed retreat of the nursery.
Even in these days of rapid modification of what
used to be thought unalterable sexual characters, one
may be bold enough to hazard the prophecy that women
who have had scientific training will, if they happen to
become mothers, hardly be disposed to give their minds
at the very outset to the rather complex and difficult
work, say, of making an accurate scientific inventory of
the several modes of infantile sensibility, visual, auditory,
and so forth, and of the alterations in these from day to day.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is for the coarser fibred man, then, to undertake
much of the earlier experimental work in the investigation
of child-nature. And if fathers will duly qualify
themselves they will probably find that permission will
little by little be given them to carry out investigations,
short, of course, of anything that looks distinctly dangerous
to the little being’s comfort.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the same time it is evident that a complete series
of observations of the infant can hardly be carried out by
a man alone. It is for the mother, or some other woman
with a pass-key to the nursery, with her frequent and
prolonged opportunities of observation to attempt a careful
and methodical register of mental progress. Hence
the importance of enlisting the mother or her female representative
as collaborateur or at least as assistant. Thus
supposing the father is bent on ascertaining the exact dates
and the order of appearance of the different articulate
sounds, which is rather a subject of passive observation
than of active experiment; he will be almost compelled
to call in the aid of one who has the considerable advantage
of passing a good part of each day near the child.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c011'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>As the wee thing grows and its nervous system becomes
more stable and robust more in the way of research
may of course be safely attempted. In this higher
stage the work of observation will be less simple and involve
more of special psychological knowledge. It is a
comparatively easy thing to say whether the sudden approach
of an object to the eye of a baby a week or so old
calls forth the reflex known as blinking: it is a much more
difficult thing to say what are the preferences of a child
of twelve months in the matter of simple forms, or even
colours.</p>

<p class='c001'>The problem of the order of development of the colour-sense
in children looks at first easy enough. Any
mother, it may be thought, can say which colours the
child first recognises by naming them when seen, or picking
them out when another names them. Yet simple as
it looks, the problem is in reality anything but simple.
A German investigator, Professor Preyer of Berlin, went
to work methodically with his little boy of two years in
order to see in what order he would discriminate colours.
Two colours, red and green, were first shown, the name
added to each, and the child then asked: “Which is
red?” “Which is green?” Then other colours were
added and the experiments repeated. According to these
researches this particular child first acquired a clear discriminative
awareness of yellow. Preyer’s results have
not, however, been confirmed by other investigators, as
M. Binet of Paris, who followed a similar method of inquiry.
Thus according to Binet it is not yellow but
blue which carries the day in the competition for the
child’s preferential recognition.</p>

<p class='c001'>What, it may be asked, is the explanation of this? Is
it that children differ in the mode of development of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>colour-sensibility to this extent, or can it be that there is
some fault in the method of investigation? It has been
recently suggested that the mode of testing colour-discrimination
by naming is open to the objection that a
child may get hold of one verbal sound as ‘red’ more
easily than another as ‘green’ and that this would facilitate
the recognition of the former. If in this way the
recognition of a colour is aided by the retention of its
name, we must get rid of this disturbing element of
sound. Accordingly new methods of experiment have
been attempted in France and America. Thus Professor
Baldwin investigates the matter by placing two colours
opposite the child’s two arms and noting which is reached
out to by right or left arm, which is ignored. He has
tabulated the results of a short series of these simple experiments
for testing childish preference, and supports
the conclusions of Binet, as against those of Preyer, that
blue comes in for the first place in the child’s discriminative
recognition.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c011'><sup>[8]</sup></a> It is however easy to see that this
method has its own characteristic defects. Thus, to begin
with, it evidently does not directly test colour discrimination
at all, but the liking for or interest in colours,
which though it undoubtedly implies a measure of discrimination
must not be confused with this. And even
as a test of preference it is very likely to be misapplied.
Thus supposing that the two colours are not equally
bright, then the child will grasp at one rather than at the
other, because it is a brighter object and not because it
is this particular colour. Again if one colour fall more
into the first and fresh period of the exercise when the
child is fresh and active, whereas another falls more into
the second period when he is tired and inactive, the results
would, it is evident, give too much value to the
former. Similarly, if one colour were brought in after
longer intervals of time than another it would have more
attractive force through its greater novelty.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Enough has been said to show how very delicate a
problem we have here to deal with. And if scientific
men are still busy settling the point how the problem
can be best dealt with, it seems hopeless for the amateur
to dabble in the matter.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have purposely chosen a problem of peculiar complexity
and delicacy in order to illustrate the importance
of that training which makes the mental eye of the observer
quick to analyse the phenomenon to be dealt with
so as to take in all its conditions. Yet there are many
parts of this work of observing the child’s mind which
do not make so heavy a demand on technical ability, but
can be done by any intelligent observer prepared for
the task by a reasonable amount of psychological study.
I refer more particularly to that rich and highly interesting
field of exploration which opens up when the child
begins to talk. It is in the spontaneous utterances of
children, his first quaint uses of words, that we can best
watch the play of the instinctive tendencies of thought.
Children’s talk is always valuable to a psychologist; and
for my part I would be glad of as many anecdotal records
of their sayings as I could collect.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here, then, there seems to be room for a relatively
simple and unskilled kind of observing work. Yet it
would be a mistake to suppose that even this branch of
child-observation requires nothing but ordinary intelligence.
To begin with, we are all prone, till by special
training we have learned to check the inclination, to read
far too much of our older thought and sentiment into
children. As M. Drox observes, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>nous sommes dupes de
nous-mêmes lorsque nous observous ces chers bambins</i></span>.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c011'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Again, there is a subtle source of error connected
with the very attitude of undergoing examination which
only a carefully trained observer of childish ways will
avoid. A child is very quick in spying whether he is
being observed, and as soon as he suspects that you are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>specially interested in his talk he is apt to try to produce
an effect. This wish to say something startling,
wonderful, or what not, will, it is obvious, detract from
the value of the utterance.</p>

<p class='c001'>But once more the saying which it is so easy to report
has had its history, and the observer who knows something
of psychology will look out for facts, that is to say,
experiences of the child, suggestions made by others’
words which throw light on the saying. No fact is really
quite simple, and the reason why some facts look so simple
is that the observer does not include in his view all the
connections of the occurrence which he is inspecting. The
unskilled observer of children is apt to send scraps, fragments
of facts, which have not their natural setting. The
value of psychological training is that it makes one as jealously
mindful of wholeness in facts as a housewife of wholeness
in her porcelain. It is, indeed, only when the whole
fact is before us, in well-defined contour, that we can begin
to deal with its meaning. Thus although those ignorant
of psychology may assist us in this region of fact-finding,
they can never accomplish that completer and exacter
kind of observation which we dignify by the name of
Science.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c011'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>One may conclude then that women may be fitted to become
valuable labourers in this new field of investigation,
if only they will acquire a genuine scientific interest in
babyhood, and a fair amount of scientific training. That a
large number of women will get so far is I think doubtful:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>the sentimental or æsthetic attraction of the baby is apt to
be a serious obstacle to a cold matter-of-fact examination
of it as a scientific specimen. The natural delight of a
mother in every new exhibition of infantile wisdom or
prowess is liable to blind her to the exceedingly modest
significance of the child’s performances as seen from the
scientific point of view. Yet as I have hinted, this very
fondness for infantile ways, may, if only the scientific
caution is added, prove a valuable excitant to study.
In England, and in America, there is already a considerable
number of women who have undergone some
serious training in psychology, and it may not be too
much to hope that before long we shall have a band of
mothers and aunts busily engaged in noting and recording
the <a id='corr23.15'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='movementsof'>movements of</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_23.15'><ins class='correction' title='movementsof'>movements of</ins></a></span> children’s minds.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have assumed here that what is wanted is careful
studies of individual children as they may be approached
in the nursery. And these records of individual children,
after the pattern of Preyer’s monograph, are I think our
greatest need. We are wont to talk rather too glibly
about that abstraction, ‘the child,’ as if all children rigorously
corresponded to one pattern, of which pattern we
have a perfect knowledge. Mothers at least know that
this is not so. Children of the same family will be found
to differ very widely (within the comparatively narrow
field of childish traits), as, for example, in respect of matter-of-factness,
of fancifulness, of inquisitiveness. Thus,
while it is probably true that most children at a certain
age are greedy of the pleasures of the imagination, Nature
in her well-known dislike of monotony has taken care
to make a few decidedly unimaginative. We need to
know much more about these variations: and what will
best help us here is a number of careful records of infant
progress, embracing examples not only of different sexes
and temperaments, but also of different social conditions
and nationalities. When we have such a collection of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>monographs we shall be in a much better position to fill
out the hazy outline of our abstract conception of childhood
with definite and characteristic lineaments.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the same time I gladly allow that other modes of
observation are possible and in their way useful. This
applies to older children who pass into the collective
existence of the school-class. Here something like collective
or statistical inquiry may be begun, as that into
the contents of children’s minds, their ignorances and
misapprehensions about common objects. Some part of
this inquiry into the minds of school-children may very
well be undertaken by an intelligent teacher. Thus it
would be valuable to have careful records of children’s
progress carried out by pre-arranged tests, so as to get
collections of examples of mental activity at different
ages. More special lines of inquiry having a truly experimental
character might be carried out by experts, as
those already begun with reference to children’s “span of
apprehension,” <i>i.e.</i>, the number of digits or nonsense syllables
that can be reproduced after a single hearing, investigations
into the effects of fatigue on mental processes,
into the effect of number of repetitions on the certainty
of reproduction, into musical sensitiveness and so forth.</p>

<p class='c001'>Valuable as such statistical investigation undoubtedly
is, it is no substitute for the careful methodical study of
the individual child. This seems to me the greatest desideratum
just now. Since the teacher needs for practical
reasons to make a careful study of individuals he might
well assist here. In these days of literary collaboration it
might not be amiss for a kindergarten teacher to write an
account of a child’s mind in co-operation with the mother.
Such a record if well done would be of the greatest value.
The co-operation of the mother seems to me quite indispensable,
since even where there is out-of-class intercourse
between teacher and pupil the knowledge acquired
by the former never equals that of the mother.</p>

  <h2 class='c016'>II. <br /> THE AGE OF IMAGINATION.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c017'><i>Why we call Children Imaginative.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>One of the few things we seemed to be certain of with
respect to child-nature was that it is fancy-full. Childhood,
we all know, is the age for dreaming, for decking out the
world as yet unknown with the gay colours of imagination;
for living a life of play or happy make-believe. So that
nothing seems more to characterise the ‘Childhood of the
World’ than the myth-making impulse which by an overflow
of fancy seeks to hide the meagreness of knowledge.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet even here, perhaps, we have been content with loose
generalisation in place of careful observation and analysis
of facts. For one thing, the play of infantile imagination
is probably much less uniform than is often supposed.
There seem to be matter-of-fact children who cannot rise
buoyantly to a bright fancy. Mr. Ruskin, of all men, has
recently told us that when a child he was incapable of
acting a part or telling a tale, that he never knew a child
“whose thirst for visible fact was at once so eager and so
methodic”.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c011'><sup>[11]</sup></a> We may accept the report of Mr. Ruskin’s
memory as proving that he did not idle away his time in
day-dreams, but, by long and close observation of running
water, and the like, laid the foundations of that fine knowledge
of the appearances of nature which everywhere shines
through his writings. Yet one may be permitted to doubt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>whether a writer who shows not only so rich and graceful a
style but so truly poetic an invention could have been <em>in
every respect</em> an unimaginative child.</p>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps the truth will turn out to be the paradox that
most children are at once matter-of-fact observers <em>and</em>
dreamers, passing from the one to the other as the mood
takes them, and with a facility which grown people may
well envy. My own observations go to show that the
prodigal out-put of fancy, the revelling in myth and story,
is often characteristic of one period of childhood only.
We are apt to lump together such different levels of experience
and capacity under that abstraction ‘the child’. The
wee mite of three and a half, spending more than half his
days in trying to realise all manner of pretty, odd, startling
fancies about animals, fairies, and the rest, is something
vastly unlike the boy of six or seven, whose mind is now
bent on understanding the make and go of machines, and
of that big machine, the world.</p>

<p class='c001'>So far as I can gather from inquiries sent to parents and
other observers of children, a large majority of boys and
girls alike are for a time fancy-bound. A child that did
not want to play and cared nothing for the marvels of
story-land would surely be regarded as queer and not just
what a child ought to be. Yet, supposing that this is the
right view, there still remains the question whether imagination
always works in the same way in the childish
brain. Science is beginning to aid us in understanding the
differences of childish fancy. For one thing it is leading
us to see that a child’s whole imaginative life may be
specially coloured by the preponderant vividness of a certain
order of images, that one child may live imaginatively in
a coloured world, another in a world of sounds, another
rather in a world of movements. It is easy to note in the
case of certain children of the more lively and active turn,
how the supreme interest of story as of play lies in the
ample range of movement and bodily activity. Robinson
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Crusoe is probably for the boyish imagination, more than
anything else, the goer and the doer.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c011'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>With this difference in the elementary constituents of
imagination, there are others which turn on temperament,
tone of feeling, and preponderant directions of emotion.
Imagination is intimately bound up with the life of feeling,
and will assume as many directions as this life assumes.
Hence, the familiar fact that in some children imagination
broods by preference on gloomy and terrifying objects,
religious and other, whereas in others it selects what is
bright and gladsome; that while in some cases it has more
of the poetic quality, in others it leans rather to the scientific
or to the practical type.</p>

<p class='c001'>Enough has been said perhaps to show that the imaginativeness
of children is not a thing to be taken for granted
as existing in all children alike. It is eminently a variable
faculty requiring a special study in the case of each new
child.</p>

<p class='c001'>But even waiving this fact of variability it may, I think,
be said that we are far from understanding the precise
workings of imagination in children. We talk, for example,
glibly about their play, their make-believe, their
illusions; but how much do we really know of their state
of mind when they act out a little scene of domestic life,
or of the battle-field? We have, I know, many fine observations
on this head. Careful observers of children and
conservers of their own childish experiences, such as
Rousseau, Pestalozzi, Jean Paul, Madame Necker, George
Sand, R. L. Stevenson, tell us much that is valuable: yet I
suspect that there must be a much wider and finer investigation
of children’s action and talk before we can feel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>quite sure that we have got at their mental whereabouts,
and know how they feel when they pretend to enter the
dark wood, the home of the wolf, or to talk with their
deities, the fairies.</p>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps I have said enough to justify my plea for new
observations and for a reconsideration of hasty theories in
the light of these. Nor need we object to a fresh survey of
what is perhaps the most delightful side of child-life. I
often wonder indeed when I come across some precious bit
of droll infantile acting, or of sweet child-soliloquy, how
mothers can bring themselves to lose one drop of the fresh
exhilarating draught which daily pours forth from the fount
of a child’s phantasy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor is it merely for the sake of its inherent charm that
children’s imagination deserves further study. In the
early age of the individual and of the race what we enlightened
persons call fancy has a good deal to do with
the first crude attempts at understanding things. Child-thought,
like primitive folk-thought, is saturated with myth,
vigorous phantasy holding the hand of reason—as yet
sadly rickety in his legs—and showing him which way he
should take. In the moral life again, we shall see how
easily the realising force of young imagination may expose
it to deception by others, and to self-deception too, with
results that closely simulate the guise of a knowing falsehood.
On the other hand a careful following out of the
various lines of imaginative activity may show how
moral education, by vividly suggesting to the child’s
imagination a worthy part, a praiseworthy action, may work
powerfully on the unformed and flexible structure of his
young will, moving it dutywards.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><i>Imaginative Transformation of Objects.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>The play of young imagination meets us in the
domain of sense-observation: a child is fancying when he
looks at things and touches them and moves among them.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>This may seem a paradox at first, but in truth there is
nothing paradoxical here. It is an exploded psychological
fallacy that sense and imagination are wholly apart. No
doubt, as the ancients told us, phantasy follows and is the
offspring of sense: we live over again in waking and sleeping
imagination the sights and sounds of the real world.
Yet it is no less true that imagination in an active constructive
form takes part in the very making of what we
call sense-experience. We <em>read</em> the visual symbol, say,
a splash of light or colour, now as a stone, now as a pool
of water, just because imagination drawing from past experience
supplies the interpretation, the group of qualities
which composes a hard solid mass, or a soft yielding
liquid.</p>

<p class='c001'>A child’s fanciful reading of things, as when he calls
the twinkling star a (blinking) eye, or the dew-drops on
the grass tears, is but an exaggeration of what we all do.
His imagination carries him very much farther. Thus he
may attribute to the stone he sees a sort of stone-soul, and
speak of it as feeling tired of a place.</p>

<p class='c001'>This lively way of envisaging objects is, as we know,
similar to that of primitive folk, and has something of
crude nature-poetry in it. This tendency is abundantly
illustrated in the metaphors which play so large a part
in children’s talk. As all observers of them know they
are wont to describe what they see or hear by analogy
to something they know already. This is called by
some, rather clumsily I think, apperceiving. For example,
a little boy of two years and five months, on
looking at the hammers of a piano which his mother
was playing, called out: ‘There is owlegie’ (diminutive
of owl). His eye had instantly caught the similarity
between the round felt disc of the hammer divided
by a piece of wood, and the owl’s face divided by
its beak. In like manner the boy C. called a small
oscillating compass-needle a ‘bird’ on the ground of its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>slightly bird-like form, and of its fluttering movement.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c011'><sup>[13]</sup></a>
Pretty conceits are often resorted to in this assimilation
of the new and strange to the familiar, as when a child
seeing dew on the grass said, ‘The grass is crying,’ or when
stars were described as “cinders from God’s star,” and
butterflies as “pansies flying”.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c011'><sup>[14]</sup></a> Other examples of this
picturesque mode of childish apperception will meet us
below.</p>

<p class='c001'>This play of imagination in connexion with apprehending
objects of sense has a strong vitalising or personifying
element. That is to say, the child sees what we regard
as lifeless and soulless as alive and conscious. Thus he
gives not only body but soul to the wind when it whistles
or howls at night. The most unpromising things come in
for this warming vitalising touch of the child’s fancy. He
will make something like a personality out of a letter.
Thus one little fellow aged one year eight months conceived a
special fondness for the letter W, addressing it thus: ‘Dear
old boy W’. Another little boy well on in his fourth year,
when tracing a letter L happened to slip so that the
horizontal limb formed an angle thus, <img class='scale11' src='images/l.jpg' height='100%' alt='L-like character' />. He instantly
saw the resemblance to the sedentary human form
and said: “Oh, he’s sitting down”. Similarly when he
made an F turn the wrong way and then put the
correct form to the left thus, <img class='scale12' src='images/ff.jpg' height='100%' alt='F reversed F' />, he exclaimed: “They’re
talking together”.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sometimes this endowment of things with feeling leads
to a quaint manifestation of sympathy. Miss Ingelow
writes of herself: When a little over two years old, and
for about a year after “I had the habit of attributing
intelligence not only to all living creatures, the same
amount and kind of intelligence that I had myself, but
even to stones and manufactured articles. I used to feel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>how dull it must be for the pebbles in the causeway to be
obliged to lie still and only see what was round about.
When I walked out with a little basket for putting flowers
in I used sometimes to pick up a pebble or two and carry
them on to have a change: then at the farthest point of
the walk turn them out, not doubting that they would be
pleased to have a new view.”<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c011'><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This is by no means a unique example of a quaint
childish expression of pity for what we think the insentient
world. Plant-life seems often to excite the feeling.
Here is a quotation from a parent’s chronicle: “A girl aged
eight, brings a quantity of fallen autumn leaves in to her
mother, who says, ‘Oh! how pretty, F.!’ to which the girl
answers: ‘Yes, I knew you’d love the poor things, mother,
I couldn’t bear to see them dying on the ground’. A few
days afterwards she was found standing at a window overlooking
the garden crying bitterly at the falling leaves as
they fell in considerable numbers.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I need not linger on the products of this vitalising and
personifying instinct, as we shall deal with them again when
inquiring into children’s ideas about nature. Suffice it to
say that it is wondrously active and far-reaching, constituting
one chief manifestation of childish fancy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now it may be asked whether all this analogical extension
of images to what seem to us such incongruous objects
involves a vivid and illusory apprehension of these as transformed.
Is the eyelid realised and even <em>seen</em> for the moment
as a sort of curtain, the curtain-image blending with and
transforming what is present to the eye? Are the pebbles
actually viewed as living things condemned to lie stiffly
in one place? It is of course hard to say, yet I think a
conjectural answer can be given. In this imaginative contemplation
of things the child but half observes what is
present to his eyes, one or two points only of supreme
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>interest in the visible thing, whether those of form, as in
assimilating the piano-hammer to the owl, or of action,
as the <em>falling</em> of the leaf, being selectively alluded to:
while assimilative imagination overlaying the visual impression
with the image of a similar object does the
rest. In this way the actual field of objects is apt to
get veiled, transformed by the wizard touch of a lively
fancy.</p>

<p class='c001'>No doubt there are various degrees of illusion here. In
his matter-of-fact and really scrutinising mood a child will
not confound what is seen with what is imagined: in this
case the analogy recalled is distinguished and used as an
explanation of what is seen—as when C. observed of the
panting dog: ‘Dat bow-wow like puff-puff’. On the other
hand when another little boy aged three years and nine
months seeing the leaves falling exclaimed, “See, mamma,
the leaves is flying like dickey-birds and little butterflies,”
it is hard not to think that the child’s fancy for the moment
transformed what he saw into these pretty semblances.
And one may risk the opinion that, with the little
thinking power and controlling force of will which a
child possesses, such assimilative activity of imagination
always tends to develop a degree of momentary illusion.
There is, too, as we shall see later on, abundant
evidence to show that children at first quite seriously
believe that most things, at least, are alive and have their
feelings.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is another way in which imagination may combine
with and transform sensible objects, <i>viz.</i>, by what is
commonly called association. Mr. Ruskin tells us that
when young he associated the name ‘crocodile’ with the
creature so closely that the long series of letters took on
something of the look of its lanky body. The same
writer speaks of a Dr. Grant, into whose therapeutic
hands he fell when a child. "The name (he adds)
is always associated in my mind with a brown powder—rhubarb
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>or the like—of a gritty or acrid nature....
The name always sounded to me gr-r-ish and granular."</p>

<p class='c001'>We can most of us perhaps, recall similar experiences,
where colours and sounds, in themselves indifferent, took
on either through analogy or association a decidedly repulsive
character. How far, one wonders, does this process
of transformation of things go in the case of imaginative
children? There is some reason to say that it may go
very far, and that, too, when there is no strong feeling at
work cementing the combined elements. A child’s feeling
for likeness is commonly keen and subtle, and knowledge
of the real relations of things has not yet come to check
the impulse to this free far-ranging kind of assimilation.
Before the qualities and the connexions of objects are
sufficiently known for them to be interesting in themselves,
they can only acquire interest through the combining art
of childish fancy. And the same is true of associated
qualities. A child’s ear may not dislike a grating sound,
a harsh noise, as our ear dislikes it, merely because of its
effect on the sensitive organ. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>En revanche</i></span> it will like
and dislike sounds for a hundred reasons unknown to us,
just because the quick strong fancy adding its life to that
of the senses gives to their impressions much of their
significance and much of their effect.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is one new field of investigation which is illustrating
in a curious way the wizard influence wielded by
childish imagination over the things of sense. It is well
known that a certain number of people habitually ‘colour’
the sounds they hear, imagining, for example, the sound of
a vowel, or of a musical tone, to have its characteristic
tint which they are able to describe accurately. This
‘coloured hearing,’ as it is called, is always traced back to
the dimly recalled age of childhood. Children are now
beginning to be tested and it is found that a good proportion
possess the faculty. Thus, in some researches on the
minds of Boston school-children, it was found that twenty-one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>out of fifty-three, or nearly 40 per cent., described
the tones of certain instruments as coloured.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c011'><sup>[16]</sup></a> The
particular colour ascribed to an instrument, as also the
degree of its brightness, though remaining constant in
the case of the same child, varied greatly among different
children, so that, for example, one child ‘visualised’ the tone
of a fife as pale or bright, while another imaged it as dark.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c011'><sup>[17]</sup></a>
It is highly probable that both analogy and association
play a part here.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c011'><sup>[18]</sup></a> As was recently suggested to me by
a correspondent the instance given by Locke of the
analogy between scarlet and the note of a trumpet may
easily be due in part at least to association of the tone
with the scarlet uniform.</p>

<p class='c001'>I may add that I once happened to overhear a little
girl of six talking to herself about numbers in this wise:
“Two is a dark number,” “forty is a white number”. I
questioned her and found that the digits had each its distinctive
colour; thus one was white; two, dark; three, white;
four, dark; five, pink; and so on. Nine was pointed and
dark, eleven dark green, showing that some of the digits
were much more distinctly visualised than others. Just
three years later I tested her again and found she still
visualised the digits, but not quite in the same way. Thus
although one and two were white and black and five pink as
before, three was now grey, four was red, nine had lost its
colour, and eleven oddly enough had turned from dark green
to bright yellow. This case suggests that in early life new
experiences and associations may modify the tint and shade
of sounds. However this be, children’s coloured hearing is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>worth noting as the most striking example of the general tendency
to overlay impressions of the senses with vivid images.
It seems reasonable to suppose that coloured hearing and
other allied phenomena, as the picturing of numbers, days
of the week, etc., in a certain scheme or diagrammatic arrangement,
when they show themselves after childhood are
to be viewed as survivals of early fanciful brain-work. This
fact taken along with the known vividness of the images in
coloured hearing, which in certain cases approximate to
sense-perceptions, seems to me to confirm the view here put
forth that children’s imagination may alter the world of sense
in ways which it is hard for our older and stiff-jointed minds
to follow.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have confined myself here to what I have called the
<em>play</em> of imagination, the magic transmuting of things
through the sheer liveliness and wanton activity of
childish fancy. How strong, how vivid, how dominating
such imaginative transformation may become will of course
be seen in cases where violent feeling, especially fear,
gives preternatural intensity to the mind’s realising power.
But this will be better considered later on.</p>

<p class='c001'>This transformation of the actual surroundings is
of course restrained in serious moments, and in intercourse
with older and graver folk. There is, however, a
region of child-life where it knows no check, where the
impulse to deck out the shabby reality with what is bright
and gay has all its own way. This region is Play.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><i>Imagination and Play.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>The interest of child’s play in the present connexion lies
in the fact that it is the working out into visible shape of an
inner fancy. The actual presentation may be the starting-point
of this process of imaginative projection: the child,
for example, sees the sand, the shingle and shells, and says,
‘Let us play keeping a shop’. Yet this is accidental. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>source of play is the impulse to realise a bright idea: whence,
as we shall see by-and-by, its close kinship to art as a
whole. This image is the dominating force, it is for the
time a veritable <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>idée fixe</i></span>, and everything has to accommodate
itself to this. Since the image has to be acted out, it comes
into collision with the actual surroundings. Here is the
child’s opportunity. The floor is instantly mapped out
into two hostile territories, the sofa-end becomes a horse,
a coach, a ship, or what not, to suit the exigencies of the
play.</p>

<p class='c001'>This stronger movement and wider range of imagination
in children’s pastime is explained by the characteristic
and fundamental impulse of play, the desire to be something,
to act a part. The child-adventurer as he personates
Robinson Crusoe or other hero steps out of his every-day
self and so out of his every-day world. In realising his
part he virtually transforms his surroundings, since they
take on the look and meaning which the part assigns to
them. This is prettily illustrated in one of Mr. Stevenson’s
child-songs, “The Land of Counterpane,” in which
a sick child describes the various transformations of the
bed-scene:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>And sometimes for an hour or so
I watched my leaden soldiers go,
With different uniforms and drills,
Among the bed-clothes through the hills;</p>

<p class='c001'>And sometimes sent my ships in fleets,
All up and down among the sheets;
Or brought my trees and houses out,
And planted cities all about.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Who can say to how many and to what strange play-purposes
that stolid unyielding-looking object a sofa-head
has been turned by the ingenuity of the childish brain?</p>

<p class='c001'>The impulse to act a part meets us very early and
grows out of the assimilative instinct. The very infant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>will, if there is a cup to hand, pretend to drink out of it.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c011'><sup>[19]</sup></a>
Similarly a boy of two will put the stem of his father’s
pipe into, or, if cautious, near his mouth, and make believe
that he is smoking. A little boy not yet two years old
would spend a whole wet afternoon “painting” the furniture
with the dry end of a bit of rope. In such cases, it is
evident, the playing may start from a suggestion supplied
by the sight of an object. There is no need to suppose
that in this simple kind of imitative play children knowingly
act a part. It is surely to misunderstand the
essence of play to speak of it as a fully conscious process
of imitative acting.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c011'><sup>[20]</sup></a> A child is one creature when he is
truly at play, another when he is bent on astonishing or
amusing you. It seems sufficient to say that when at play
he is possessed by an idea, and is working this out into
visible action. Your notice, your laughter, may bring in
a new element of enjoyment; for as we all know, children
are apt to be little actors in the full sense, and to aim at
producing an impression. Yet the child as little <em>needs</em>
your flattering observation as the cat needs it, when he
plays in the full sense imaginatively, and in make-believe,
with his captured mouse, placing it, for example, deliberately
under a copper in the scullery, and amusing himself
by the half-illusion of losing it. Indeed your intrusion
will be just as likely to destroy or at least to diminish the
charm of a child’s play, if only through your inability to
seize his idea, and, what is equally important, to rise to his
own point of enthusiasm and illusive realisation. Perhaps,
indeed, one may say that the play-instinct is most vigorous
and dominant when a child is alone, or at least self-absorbed;
for even social play, delightful as it is when all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>the players are attuned, is subject to disturbance through
a want of mutual comprehension and a need of half-disillusive
explanations.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c011'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The essence of children’s play is the acting of a part
and the realising of a new situation. It is thus, as we shall
see more fully by-and-by, akin to dramatic action, only
that the child’s ‘acting’ is like M. Jourdain’s prose, an
unconscious art. The impulse to be something, a sailor, a
soldier, a path-finder, or what not, absorbs the child and
makes him forget his real surroundings and his actual self.
His day-dreams, his solitary and apparently listless wanderings
while he mutters mystic words to himself, all illustrate
this desire to realise a part. In this playful self-projection
a child will become even something non-human, as when
he nips the ‘bread-and-cheese’ shoots off the bushes
and fancies himself a horse.<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c011'><sup>[22]</sup></a> It is to be noted that such
passing out of one’s ordinary self and assuming a foreign
existence is confined to the child-player; the cat or the
dog, though able, as Mr. Darwin and others have shown,
to go through a kind of make-believe game, remaining
always within the limits of his ordinary self.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such play-like transmutation of the self extends beyond
what we are accustomed to call play. One little boy of
three and a half years who was fond of playing at the useful
business of coal-heaving would carry his coal-heaver’s
dream through the whole day, and on the particular day
devoted to this calling would not only refuse to be addressed
by any less worthy name, but ask in his prayer to
be made a good coal-heaver (instead of the usual ‘good
boy’). On other days this child lived the life of a robin
redbreast, a soldier, and so forth, and bitterly resented his
mother’s occasional confusion of his personalities. A little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>girl aged only one year and ten months insisted upon
being addressed by a fancy name, Isabel, when she was
put to bed, but would not be called by this name at any
other time. She probably passed into what seemed to her
another person when she went to bed and gave herself up
to sweet ‘hypnagogic’ reverie.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the working out of this impulse to realise a
part the actual external surroundings may take a surprisingly
small part. Sometimes there is scarcely any adjustment
of scene: the child plays out his action with purely
imaginary surroundings. Such simple play-actions as
going to market to buy imaginary apples occur very early,
one mother assuring me that all her children carried them
out in the second year before they could talk. Another
mother writes of her boy, aged two and a half years: “He
amuses himself by pretending things. He will fetch an
imaginary cake from a corner, rake together imaginary
grass, or fight a battle with imaginary soldiers.” This
reminds one of Mr. Stevenson’s lines:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>It is he, when you play with your soldiers of tin,
Who sides with the French and who never can win.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>This impulse to invent imaginary surroundings, and
more especially to create mythical companions, is very
common among lonely and imaginative children. A lady
friend, a German, tells me that when she was a
little girl, a lonely one of course, she invented a kind of
<em>alter ego</em>, another girl rather older than herself, whom she
named ‘Krofa’—why she has forgotten. She made a
constant playmate of her, and got all her new ideas from
her. Mr. Canton’s little heroine took to nursing an invisible
‘iccle gaal’ (little girl), the image of which she
seemed able to project into space.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c011'><sup>[23]</sup></a> The invention of
fictitious persons fills a large space in child-life. Perhaps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>if only the young imagination is strong enough there is, as
already hinted, more of sweet illusion, of a warm grasp of
living reality in this solitary play, where fictitious companions
perfectly obedient to the little player’s will take
the place of less controllable tangible ones. But such
purely imaginative make-believe, which derives no help
from actual things, is perhaps hardly ‘play’ in the full
sense, but rather an active form of day-dreaming or
romancing.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c011'><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In much of this playful performance all the interference
with actual surroundings that the child requires is change
of place or scene. Here is a pretty example of this
simple type of imaginative play. A child of twenty months,
who is accustomed to meet a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>bonne</i></span> and child in the Jardin
du Luxembourg, suddenly leaves the family living-room,
pronouncing indifferently well the names Luxembourg,
nurse, and child. He goes into the next room, pretends
to say “good-day” to his two out-door acquaintances, and
then returns and simply narrates what he has been doing.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c011'><sup>[25]</sup></a>
Here the simple act of passing into an adjoining room was
enough to secure the needed realisation of the encounter in
the garden. The movement into the next room is suggestive.
Primarily it meant no doubt the child’s manner of
realising the out-of-door walk; yet I suspect there was
another motive at work. Children love to enact their little
play-scenes in some remote spot, withdrawn from notice,
where imagination suffers no let from the interference of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>mother, nurse, or other member of the real environment.
How many a thrilling exciting play has been carried out in
a corner, especially if it be dark, or better still, screened off.
The fascination of curtained spaces, as those behind the
window curtains, or under the table with the table-cloth
hanging low, will be fresh in the memory of all who can
recall their childhood.</p>

<p class='c001'>A step towards a more realistic kind of play-action, in
which, as in the modern theatre, imagination is propped up
by strong stage effects, is taken when a scene is constructed,
the chairs and sofa turned into ships, carriages, a railway
train, and so forth.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet, after all, the scene is but a very subordinate part
of the play. Next to himself in his new part, proudly
enjoying the consciousness of being a general, or a school-mistress,
a child who is not content with the pure creations
of his phantasy requires the semblance of living companions.
In all play he desires somebody, if only as
listener to his talk in his new character; and when he does
not rise to an invisible auditor, he will talk to such unpromising
things as a sponge in the bath, a fire-shovel, a
clothes’ prop in the garden, and so forth. In more active play,
where something has to be done, he generally desires a full
companion and assistant, human or animal. And here we
meet with what is perhaps the most interesting feature of
childish play, the transmutation of the most meagre and
least promising of things into complete living forms. I have
already alluded to the sofa-head. How many forms of
animal life, vigorous and untiring, from the patient donkey
up to the untamed horse of the prairies, has this most inert-looking
ridge served to image forth to quick boyish
perception.</p>

<p class='c001'>The introduction of these living things seems to illustrate
the large compass of the child’s realising power. Mr.
Ruskin speaks somewhere of “the perfection of child-like
imagination, the power of making everything out of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>nothing”. “The child,” he adds, "does not make a pet
of a mechanical mouse that runs about the floor.... The
child falls in love with a quiet thing—with an ugly one—nay,
it may be with one to us totally devoid of meaning.
The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>besoin de croire</i></span> precedes the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>besoin d’aimer</i></span>."</p>

<p class='c001'>The quotation brings us to the focus where the rays of
childish imagination seem to converge, the transformation
of toys.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fact that children make living things out of their
toy horses, dogs and the rest, is known to every observer
of their ways. To the natural unsceptical eye the boy on
his rudely carved “gee-gee” slashing the dull flank with
all a boy’s glee, looks as if he were realising the joy
of actual riding, as if he were possessed with the fancy
that the stiff least organic-looking of structures which he
strides is a very horse.</p>

<p class='c001'>The liveliness of this realising imagination is seen in
the extraordinary poverty and meagreness of the toys
which to their happy possessors are wholly satisfying.
Here is a pretty picture of child’s play from a German
writer:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>There sits a little charming master of three years before his
small table busied for a whole hour in a fanciful game with shells.
He has three so-called snake-heads in his domain; a large one and
two smaller ones: this means two calves and a cow. In a tiny
tin dish the little farmer has put all kinds of petals, that is the
fodder for his numerous and fine cattle.... When the play has
lasted a time the fodder-dish transforms itself into a heavy waggon
with hay: the little shells now become little horses, and are put to
the shafts to pull the terrible load.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The doll takes a supreme place in this fancy realm of
play. It is human and satisfies higher instincts and emotions.
As the French poet says, the little girl—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rêve el nom de mère en berçant sa poupée.</span><a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c011'><sup>[26]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>I read somewhere recently that the doll is a plaything
for girls only: but boys, though they often prefer india-rubber
horses and other animals, not infrequently go
through a stage of doll-love also, and are hardly less
devoted than girls. Endless is the variety of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>rôle</i></span> assigned
to the doll as to the tiny shell in our last picture of play.
The doll is the all-important comrade in that <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>solitude à
deux</i></span> of which the child, like the adult, is so fond. Mrs.
Burnett tells us that sitting holding her doll in the armchair
of the parlour she would sail across enchanted seas to
enchanted islands having all sorts of thrilling adventures.
At another time when she wanted to act an Indian chief
the doll just as obediently took up the part of squaw.</p>

<p class='c001'>Very humanely, on the whole, is the little doll-lover
wont to use her pet, even though, as George Sand reminds
us, there come moments of rage and battering.<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c011'><sup>[27]</sup></a> A little
boy of two and a half years asked his mother one day:
“Will you give me all my picture-books to show dolly?
I don’t know which he will like best.” He then pointed
to each and looked at the doll’s face for the answer. He
made believe that it selected one, and then gravely showed
it all the pictures, saying: “Look here, dolly!” and carefully
explaining them.</p>

<p class='c001'>The doll illustrates the childish attitude towards all
toys, the impulse to take them into the innermost and
warmest circle of personal intimacy, to make them a living
part of himself. A child’s language, as we shall see later,
points to an early identification of self with belongings.
The ‘me’ and the ‘my’ are the same, or nearly the same,
to a mite of three. This impulse to attach the doll to self,
or to embrace it within the self-consciousness or self-feeling,
shows itself in odd ways. In the grown-up child,
Laura Bridgman, it took the form of putting a bandage
like her own over her doll’s eyes. This resembles a case of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>a girl of six, who when recovering from measles was observed
to be busily occupied with her dolls, each of which she
painted over with bright red spots. The dolly must do all,
and be all that I am: so the child in his warm attachment
seems to argue. This feeling of oneness is strengthened by
that of exclusive possession, the sense that the child himself
is the only one who really knows dolly, can hear her cry
when she cries and so forth.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c011'><sup>[28]</sup></a> It is another manifestation
of the same feeling of intimacy and solidarity when a child
insists on dolly’s being treated by others as courteously
as himself. Children will often expect the mother or
nurse to kiss and say good-night to their pet or pets—for
their hearts are capacious—when she says good-night to
themselves.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here, nobody can surely doubt, we have clearest evidence
of play-illusion. The lively imagination endows the
inert wooden thing with the warmth of life and love.
How large a part is played here by the alchemist, fancy,
is known to all observers of children’s playthings. The
faith and the devotion often seem to increase as the first
meretricious charms, the warm tints of the cheek and the
lips, the well-shaped nose, the dainty clothes, prematurely
fade, and the lovely toy which once kept groups of hungry-looking
children gazing long at the shop-window, is reduced
to the naked essence of a doll. A child’s constancy to his
doll when thus stript of exterior charms and degraded to
the lowest social stratum of dolldom is one of the sweetest
and most humorous things in child-life.</p>

<p class='c001'>And then what rude unpromising things are adopted
as doll-pets. Mrs. Burnett tells us she once saw a dirty
mite sitting on a step in a squalid London street, cuddling
warmly a little bundle of hay tied round the middle by a
string. Here, surely, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>besoin d’aimer</i></span> was little if anything
behind the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>besoin de croire</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Do any of us really understand this doll-superstition?
Writers of a clear long-reaching memory have tried to take
us back to childhood, and restore to us for a moment the
whole undisturbed trust, the perfect satisfaction of love,
which the child brings to its doll. Yet even the imaginative
genius of a George Sand is hardly equal, perhaps, to
the feat of resuscitating the buried companion of our early
days and making it live once more before our eyes.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c011'><sup>[29]</sup></a> The
truth is the doll-illusion is one of the first to pass. There
are, I believe, a few sentimental girls who, when they
attain the years of enlightenment, make a point of saving
their dolls from the general wreckage of toys. Yet I suspect
the pets when thus retained are valued more for the outside
charm of pretty face and hair, and still more for the
lovely clothes, than for the inherent worth of the doll itself,
of what we may call the doll-soul which informs it and
gives it, for the child, its true beauty and its worth.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet if we cannot get inside the old doll-superstition we
may study it from the outside, and draw a helpful comparison
between it and other known forms of naïve
credulity. And here we have the curious fact that the
doll exists not only for the child but for the “nature man”.
Savages, Sir John Lubbock tells us,<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c011'><sup>[30]</sup></a> like toys, such as
dolls, Noah’s Arks, etc. The same writer remarks that the
doll is “a hybrid between the baby and the fetish, and that
it exhibits the contradictory characters of its parents”.
Perhaps the changes of mood towards the doll, of which
George Sand writes, illustrate the alternating preponderance
of the baby and the fetish half. But as Sir John also
remarks, this hybrid is singularly unintelligible to grown-up
people, and it seems the part of modesty here to bow to
one of nature’s mysteries.</p>

<p class='c001'>It has been suggested to me by Mr. F. Galton that a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>useful inquiry might be carried out into the relation between
a child’s preference in the matter of doll or other toy
and the degree of his imaginativeness as otherwise shown,
<i>e.g.</i>, in craving for story, and in romancing. So far as I have
inquired I am disposed to think that such a relation exists.
A lady who has had a large experience as a Kindergarten
teacher tells me that children who play with rough shapeless
things, and readily endow with life the ball, and so forth, in
Kindergarten games are imaginative in other ways. Here
is an example:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>P. Mc. L., a girl, observed from three and a half to five years of
age, was a highly imaginative child as shown by the power of make-believe
in play. The ball of soft india-rubber was to her on the teacher’s
suggestion, say, a baby, and on it she would lavish all her tenderness,
kissing it, feeding it, washing its face, dressing it in her pinafore, etc.
So thorough was her delight in the play that the less imaginative
children around her would suspend their play at ‘babies’ and watch
her with interest. Whilst a most indifferent restless child at lessons,
whenever a story was told she sat motionless and wide-eyed till
the close.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Children sometimes make babies of their younger
brothers and sisters, going through all the sweet solicitous
offices which others are wont to carry out on their dolls.<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c011'><sup>[31]</sup></a>
This suggests another and closely related question: Do
the more imaginative children prefer the inert, ugly doll
to the living child in these nursing pastimes? What is the
real relation in the child’s play between the toy-companion,
the doll or india-rubber dog, and the living companion?
Again, a child will occasionally play with an imaginary
doll.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c011'><sup>[32]</sup></a> How is this impulse related to the other two forms
of doll-passion? These points would well repay a careful
investigation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The vivification of the doll or toy animal is the outcome
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>of the play-impulse, and this, as we have seen, is an
impulse to act out, to realise an idea in outward show.
The absorption in the idea and its outward expression
serves, as in the case of the hypnotised subject, to blot out
the incongruities of scene and action which you or I, a
cold observer, would note. The play-idea works transformingly
by a process analogous to what is called auto-suggestion.</p>

<p class='c001'>How complete this play-illusion may become here can
be seen in more ways than one. We see it in the jealous
insistence already illustrated that everything shall for the
time pass over from the every-day world into the new
fancy-created one. “About the age of four,” writes M. Egger
of his boys, “Felix is playing at being coachman, Emile
happens to return home at the moment. In announcing
his brother, Felix does not say, ‘Emile is come,’ he says
‘The brother of the coachman is come’.”<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c011'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>As we saw above, the child’s absorption in his new
play-world is shown by his imperious demand that others,
as his mother, shall recognise his new character. Pestalozzi’s
little boy, aged three years and a half, was one day playing
at being butcher, when his mother called him by his usual
diminutive, ‘Jacobli’. He at once replied: “No, no; you
should call me butcher now”.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c011'><sup>[34]</sup></a> Here is a story to the same
effect, sent me by a mother. A little girl of four was playing
‘shops’ with her younger sister. “The elder one was
shopman at the time I came into her room and kissed her.
She broke out into piteous sobs, I could not understand
why. At last she sobbed out: ‘Mother, you never kiss the
man in the shop’. I had with my kiss quite spoilt her illusion.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The intensity of the realising power of imagination in play
is seen too in the stickling for fidelity to the original in all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>playful reproduction, whether of scenes observed in everyday
life or of what has been narrated. The same little
boy who showed his picture-books to dolly was, we are told,
when two years and eight months old, fond of imagining
that he was Priest, his grandmamma’s coachman. “He
drives his toy horse from the arm-chair as a carriage,
getting down every minute to ‘let the ladies out,’ or to ‘go
shopping’. The make-believe extends to his insisting on
the reins being held while he gets down and so forth.”
The same thing shows itself in acting out stories. The
full enjoyment of the realisation depends on the faithful
reproduction, on the suitable outward embodiment of the
distinct idea in the child’s mind.</p>

<p class='c001'>The following anecdote bears another kind of testimony,
a most winsome kind, to the realising power of play. One
day two sisters said to one another: “Let us play being
sisters”. This might well sound insane enough to hasty ears;
but is it not really eloquent? To me it suggests that the
girls felt they were not realising their sisterhood, enjoying
all the possible sweets of it, as they wanted to do—perhaps
there had been a quarrel and a supervening childish coldness.
And they felt too that the way to get this more vivid
sense of what they were, or ought to be, one to the other, was
by playing the part, by acting a scene in which they would
come close to one another in warm sympathetic fellowship.</p>

<p class='c001'>But there is still another, and some will think a more
conclusive way of satisfying ourselves of the reality of the
play-illusion. The child finds himself confronted by the
unbelieving adult who questions what he says about the
doll’s crying and so forth. One little girl, aged one year and
nine months, when asked by her mother how her doll, who
had lost his arms, ate his dinner without hands, quickly
changed the subject. She did not apparently like having
difficulties brought into her happy play-world. But the true
tenacious faith shows itself later when the child understands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>these sceptical questionings of others, and sees that they are
poking fun at his play and his day-dreamings. Such cruel
quizzings of his make-believe are apt to cut him to the
quick. I have heard of children who will cry if a stranger
suddenly enters the nursery when they are hard at play,
and shows himself unsympathetic and critical.</p>

<p class='c001'>Play may produce not only this vivid imaginative
realisation at the time, but a sort of mild permanent
illusion. Sometimes it is a toy-horse, in one case communicated
to me it was a funny-looking toy-lion, more frequently
it is the human effigy, the doll, which as the result of
successive acts of imaginative vivification gets taken up
into the relation of permanent companion and pet.
Clusters of happy associations gather about it, investing it
with a lasting vitality and character. A mother once asked
her boy of two and a half years if his doll was a boy or a
girl. He said at first, “A boy,” but presently correcting
himself added, “I think it is a baby”. Here we have a
challenging of the inner conviction by a question, a moment
of reflexion, and as a result of this, an unambiguous
confession of faith that the doll had its place in the living
human family.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here is a more stubborn exhibition on the part of another
boy of this lasting faith in the plaything called out
by others’ sceptical attitude. "When (writes a lady correspondent)
he was just over two years old L. began to speak
of a favourite wooden horse (Dobbin) as if it were a real
living creature. ‘No tarpenter (carpenter) made Dobbin,’
he would say, ‘he is not wooden but kin (skin) and bones
and Dod (God) made him.’ If any one said ‘it’ in speaking
of the horse his wrath was instantly aroused, and he would
shout indignantly: ‘It! You mutt’ent tay “it,” you mut tay
<em>he</em>’. He imagined the horse was possessed of every virtue
and it was strange to see what an influence this creature of
his own imagination exercised over him. If there was
anything L. particularly wished not to do his mother had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>only to say: ‘Dobbin would like you to do this,’ and it was
done without a murmur."</p>

<p class='c001'>There is another domain of childish activity closely
bordering on that of play where a like suffusion of the
world of sense by imagination meets us. I refer to pictures
and artistic representations generally. If in the case of adults
there is a half illusion, a kind of oneirotic or trance condition
induced by a picture or dramatic spectacle, in the case of
the less-instructed child the illusion is apt to become more
complete. A picture seems very much of a toy to a child.
A baby of eight or nine months will talk to a picture as to
a living thing; and something of this tendency to make a
fetish of a drawing survives much later. But it will be
more convenient to deal with the attitude of the child-mind
towards pictorial representations in connexion with his art-tendencies.</p>

<p class='c001'>The imaginative transformation of things, more
particularly the endowing of lifeless things with life, enters,
I believe, into all children’s pastimes. Whence comes the
perennial charm, the undying popularity, of the hoop? Is
not the interest here due to the circumstance that the
child controls a moving thing which in the capricious variations
of its course simulates a free will of its own? As I
understand it, trundling the hoop is imaginative play hardly
less than riding the horse-stick and slashing its flanks.
Who again that can recall early experiences will doubt that
the delight of flying the kite, of watching it as it sways to
the right or to the left, threatening to fall head-foremost
to earth, and most of all perhaps of sending a paper
‘messenger’ along the string to the wee thing poised like
a bird so terribly far away in the blue sky, is the delight of
imaginative play? The same is true of sailing boats, and
other pastimes of early childhood.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have here touched merely on the imaginative and
half-illusory side of children’s play. It is to be remembered,
however, that play is much more than this, and reflects
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>much more of the childish mind. Play proper as distinguished
from mere day-dreaming is activity and imitative
activity; and children show marked differences in the
energy of this activity, and in the quickness and closeness
of their responses to the model actions of the real
nurse, real coachman, and so forth. That is to say, observation
of others will count here. Again, while social
surroundings, opportunities for imitation, are important,
they are by no means all-decisive. Children show a
curious selectiveness in their imitative games, germs of
differential interest, sexual and individual, revealing themselves
quite early. It may be added that a child with few
opportunities of observation may get quite enough play-material
from storyland. But play is never merely
imitative, save indeed in the case of unintelligent and
‘stoggy’ children. It is a bright invention into which
all the gifts of childish intelligence may pour themselves.
The relation of play to art will engage us later on.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><i>Free Projection of Fancies.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>In play and the kindred forms of imaginative activity
just dealt with, we have been concerned with imaginative
realisation in its connexion with sense-perception.
And here, it is to be noticed, there is a kind of reciprocal
action between sense and imagination. On the one hand,
as we have seen, imagination interposes a coloured medium,
so to speak, between the eye and the object, so that it
becomes transformed and beautified. On the other hand,
in what is commonly called playing, imaginative activity
receives valuable aid from the senses. The stump of a
doll, woefully unlike as it is to what the child’s fancy
makes it, is yet a sensible fact, and as such gives support
and substance to the realising impulse.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now this fact that imagination derives support from
sense leads to a habit of projecting fancies, and giving them
an external and local habitation. In this way the idea
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>receives a certain solidity and fixity through its embodiment
in the real physical world.</p>

<p class='c001'>This incorporation of images in the system of the real
world may, like play, start at one of two ends. On the
one hand, the external world, so far as it is only dimly
perceived, excites wonder, curiosity, and the desire to fill
in the blank spaces with at least the semblance of knowledge.
Here distance exercises a strange fascination. The
remote chain of hills faintly visible from the child’s home,
has been again and again endowed by his enriching fancy
with all manner of wondrous scenery and peopled by all
manner of strange creatures. The unapproachable sky—which
to the little one, so often on his back, is much more
of a visible object than to us—with its wonders of blue expanse
and cloudland, of stars and changeful moon, is wont
to occupy his mind, his bright fancy quite spontaneously
filling out this big upper world with appropriate forms.</p>

<p class='c001'>This stimulating effect of the half-perceivable is seen
in still greater intensity in the case of what is hidden from
sight. The spell cast on the young mind by the mystery
of holes, and especially of dark woods, and the like, is
known to all. C.’s peopling of a dark wood with his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>bêtes
noires</i></span> the wolves illustrates this tendency.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What (writes a German author already quoted) all
childish fancy has almost without exception in common, is
the idea of a wholly new and unheard-of world behind the
remote horizon, behind woods, lakes and hills, and all
objects reached by the eye. When I was a child and we
played hide and seek in the barn, I always felt that there
must or might be behind every bundle of straw, and
especially in the corners, something unheard of lying
hidden. And yet I had no profane curiosity, no desire to
experiment by turning over the bundle of straw. It was
just a fancy, and though I half recognised it as such it was
lively enough to engage me as a reality.” The same
writer goes on to describe how his imagination ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>occupied itself with what lay behind the long stretch of wood
which closed in a large part of his child’s horizon.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c011'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This imaginative filling up of the remote and the hidden
recesses of the outer world is subject to manifold stimulating
influences from the region of feeling. We know that all
vivid imagination is charged with emotion, and this is emphatically
true of children’s phantasies. The unseen, the
hidden, contains unknown possibilities, something awful,
terrible, it may be, to make the timid wee thing shudder
in anticipatory vision, or wondrously and surprisingly
beautiful. How far the childish attitude is from intellectual
curiosity is seen in the remark of Goltz, that no impious
attempt is made to probe the mystery.</p>

<p class='c001'>The other way in which this happy fusion of fancy
with incomplete perception may be effected is through the
working of the impulse to give outward embodiment to
vivid and persistent images. All play, as we have seen,
is an illustration of the impulse, and certain kinds of play
show the working of the impulse in its purity. It
extends, however, beyond the limits of what is commonly
known as play. The instance quoted above, the peopling
of a certain wood with wolves by the child C., was of course
due in part to the fact that the small impressionable brain
was at this time much occupied with the idea of the wolf.
Dickens and others have told us how when children they
were wont to project into the real world the lively images
acquired from storyland. When suitable objects present
themselves the images are naturally enough linked on to
these. Thus Dickens writes: “Every burn in the neighbourhood,
every stone of the church, every foot of the
churchyard had some association of its own in my mind
connected with these books (<cite>Roderic Random</cite>, <cite>Tom Jones</cite>,
<cite>Gil Blas</cite>, etc.), and stood for some locality made famous in
them. I have seen Tom Piper go climbing up the church
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>steeple; I have watched Strap with the knapsack on his
back stopping to rest himself on the wicket-gate.”<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c011'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Along with this attachment of images to definite objects
there goes a good deal of vague localisation in dim half-realised
quarters of space. The supernatural beings, the
fairies, the bogies, and the rest, are, as might be expected,
relegated to these obscure and impenetrable regions. It
would be worth while perhaps to collect a children’s comparative
mythology, if only to see what different localities,
geographic and cosmic, the childish mind is apt to assign
to his fabulous beings. The poor fairies seem to have been
forced to find an abode in most dissimilar regions. The
boy C. selected the wall of his bedroom—hardly a dignified
abode, though it had the merit of being within reach of his
prayers. A child less bent on turning the superior personages
to practical account will set them in some remoter
quarter, in a vast forest, or deep cavern, on a distant hill,
or higher up in the blue above the birds. But systems of
child-mythology will occupy us again.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><i>Imagination and Storyland.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>We may now pass to a freer region of imaginative
activity where the child’s mind gives life and reality to its
images without incorporating them into the outer sensible
world, even to the extent of talking to invisible playmates.
The world of story, as distinct from that of play, is the
great illustration of this detached activity of fancy.</p>

<p class='c001'>The entrance into storyland can only take place when
the key of language is put into the child’s hand. A story
is a verbal representation of a scene or action, and the
process of imaginative realisation depends in this case on
the stimulating effect of words in their association with
ideas. Now a word has not for a child the peculiar force of
an imitative sensuous impression, say that of a picture.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>The toy, the picture, being, however roughly, a likeness or
show, brings the idea before the child’s eyes in a way in
which the word-symbol cannot do. Yet we may easily underestimate
the stimulating effect of words on children’s minds,
which are much more tender and susceptible than we are
wont to suppose. To call out to a child, ‘Bow, wow!’
or ‘Policeman!’ may be to excite in his mind a vivid
image which is in itself an approach to a complete sensuous
realisation of the thing. We cannot understand the fascination
of a story for children save by remembering that for
their young minds, quick to imagine and unversed in
abstract reflexion, words are not dead thought-symbols,
but truly alive and perhaps “winged” as the old Greeks
called them.</p>

<p class='c001'>It may not be easy to explain fully this stimulating
power of words on the childish mind. There is some
reason to say that in these early days spoken words as
sounds for the ear have in themselves something of the
immediate objective reality of all sense-impressions, so that
to name a thing is in a sense to make it present.
However this be, words as sense-presentations have
a powerful suggestive effect on children’s imagination,
calling up particularly vivid images of the objects
named. The effect is probably aided by the child’s
nascent feeling of reverence for another’s words as authoritative
utterances.</p>

<p class='c001'>This impulse to realise words makes the child a listener
much more frequently than we suppose. How often is the
mother surprised and amused at a question put by her
child about something said in his presence to a servant, a
visitor, or a workman; something which in her grown-up
way she assumed would not be of the slightest interest to
him. In this manner, words soon become a great power in
the new wondering life of a child. They lodge like flying
seedlings in the fertile brain, and shoot up into strange
imaginative growths. But of this more by-and-by.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>This profound and lasting effect of words is nowhere
more clearly seen than in the spell of the story. We
grown-up people are wont to flatter ourselves that we read
stories: the child, if he could know what we call reading,
would laugh at it. With what deftness does the little
brain disentangle the language, often strange and puzzling
enough, reducing it by a secret child-art to simplicity and
to reality. A mother when reading a poem to her boy of
six, ventured to remark, “I’m afraid you can’t understand
it, dear,” for which she got duly snubbed by her little
master in this fashion: “Oh, yes, I can very well,
if only you would not explain”. The explaining is resented
because it interrupts the child’s own spontaneous
image-building, wherein lies the charm, because it rudely
breaks the spell of the illusion, calling off the attention
from the vision he sees in the word-crystal, which is all he
cares about, to the cold lifeless crystal itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>And what a bright vision it is that is there gained.
How clearly scene after scene of the dissolving view unfolds
itself. How thrilling the anticipation of the next
unknown, undiscernible stage in the history. Perhaps no
one has given us a better account of the state of absorption
in storyland, the oneirotic or dream-like condition of
complete withdrawal from the world of sense into an inner
world of fancy, than Thackeray. In one of his delightful
“Roundabout Papers,” he thus writes of the experiences of
early boyhood. "Hush! I never read quite to the end
of my first <cite>Scottish Chiefs</cite>. I couldn’t. I peeped in an
alarmed furtive manner at some of the closing pages....
Oh, novels, sweet and delicious as the raspberry open tarts
of budding boyhood! Do I forget one night after prayers
(when we under-boys were sent to bed) lingering at my
cupboard to read one little half-page more of my dear
Walter Scott—and down came the monitor’s dictionary on
my head!"</p>

<p class='c001'>As one thinks of the deep delights of these first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>excursions into storyland one almost envies the lucky boys
whom the young Charles Dickens held spellbound with
his tales.</p>

<p class='c001'>The intensity of the delight is seen in the greed it
generates. Who can resist the child’s hungry demand for
a story? Edgar Quinet in his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Histoire de mes Idées</cite></span> tells
how when a child an old corporal came to drill him.
He had been taken prisoner by the Spaniards and placed on
an inaccessible island. Edgar loved to hear the thrilling
story of the old soldier’s adventures, and scarcely was the
narrative finished when the greedy boy would exclaim,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Encore une fois!”</span> Heine’s delight when a boy at Düsseldorf
in drinking in the stories of Napoleon’s exploits
from his drummer is another well-known illustration.</p>

<p class='c001'>Through the perfect gift of visual realisation which a
child brings to it the verbal narrative becomes a record of
fact, a true history. The intense enjoyment which is
bound up with this process of imaginative realisation
makes children jealously exact as to accuracy in repetition.
The boy C. when a story was repeated to him used to
resent even a small alteration of the text. Woe to the
unfortunate mother who in telling one of the good stock
nursery tales varies a detail. One such, a friend of mine,
repeating ‘Puss in Boots’ inadvertently made the hero
sit on a chair instead of on a box to pull on his boots.
She was greeted by a sharp volley of ‘No’s!’ The same
lady tells me that when narrating the story of ‘Beauty and
the Beast’ for the second time only she forgot in describing
the effect of the Beast’s sighing to add after the words
‘till the glasses on the table shake’ ‘and the candles are
nearly blown out’; whereupon the severe little listener
at once stopped the narrator and supplied the interesting
detail. The exacting memory of childhood in the matter
of stories is the product of a full detailed realisation. In
the case just quoted the reality of the story was contradicted
by substituting a stupid conventional chair for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>the box, and by omitting the striking incident of the
candles.</p>

<p class='c001'>Happy age of childhood, when a new and wondrous
world, created wholly by the magic of a lively phantasy, rivals
in brightness, in distinctness of detail, aye, and in steadfastness
too, the nearest spaces of the world on which the
bodily eye looks out, before reflexion has begun to draw
a hard dividing line between the domains of historical truth
and fiction.</p>

<p class='c001'>As the demand for faithful repetition of story shows,
the imaginative realisation continues when the story is no
longer heard or read. It has added something to the
child’s inner supplementary world, given him one more
lovely region in which he may live blissful moments. The
return of the young mind to the persons and scenes of
story is forcibly illustrated in the impulse, already touched
on, to act out in play the parts of this and that heroic figure.
With many children any narrative which holds the imagination
delightfully enthralled is likely to become more fully
realised in a visible embodiment. For instance, a child of
five years, when told a story of four men going along a
railway to stop a train before it neared a bridge which was
on fire, at once proceeded to play the incident with his toy
train. Here we see how story by contributing lively
images to the child’s brain becomes one main stimulative
and guiding influence in the domain of play. In like
manner the images born of story may, as in the case of
Dickens, attach themselves permanently to particular
localities and objects.</p>

<p class='c001'>To this lively imaginative reception of what is told him
the child is apt very soon to join his own free inventions
of figures, human, superhuman, or subhuman. The higher
qualities of this invention properly come under the head of
child-art, and will have to be considered in another chapter.
Here we may glance at these inventions as illustrating the
realising power of the child’s imagination.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>This invention appears in a sporadic manner in occasional
‘romancings’ which may set out from some
observation of the senses. A little boy aged three and a
half years seeing a tramp limping along with a bad leg
exclaimed: “Look at that poor ole man, mamma, he has dot
(got) a bad leg”. Then romancing, as he was now wont to
do: “He dot on a very big ’orse, and he fell off on some
great big stone, and he hurt his poor leg and he had to get
a big stick. We must make it well.” Then after a
thoughtful pause: “Mamma, go and kiss the place and put
some powdey (powder) on it and make it well like you do
to I”. The unmistakable childish seriousness here, the
outflow of young compassion, and the charming enforcement
of the nursery prescription, all point to a vivid realisation
of this extemporised little romance. This child was
moreover more than commonly tender-hearted, and perhaps
the more exposed on that account to such amiable self-deception.
Another small boy when a little over two years,
happening to hear a buzzing on the window, said:
“Mamma, bumble-bee in a window says it wants a yump
(lump) of sugar”: then shaking his head sternly, added:
“Soon make you heat-spots, bumble-bee”. Other examples
of this romancing will be met with in the notes on the
child C.</p>

<p class='c001'>In such simple fashion does the child build up a tiny
myth on the basis of some passing impression, supplying
out of his quaintly stored fancy unlooked-for adornments
to the homely occurrences of every-day life.</p>

<p class='c001'>Partly by taking in and fully realising the wonders of
story, partly by the independent play of an inventive
imagination, children’s minds pass under the dominion of
more or less enduring myths. The princes and princesses and
dwarfs and gnomes of fairy-tale, the workers of Christmas
miracles, Santa Claus and Father Christmas, as well as the
beings fashioned by the child’s imagination on the model of
those he knows from story, these live on like the people of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>the every-day world, are apt to appear in dreams, in the
dark, at odd dreamy moments when the things of sense
lose their hold, bringing into the child’s life golden sunlight
or black awful shadows, the most real of all realities.</p>

<p class='c001'>This childish belief in myth is often curiously tenacious.
A father was once surprised to find that his boy aged five
years and ten months continued naïvely to believe in the
real personality of Santa Claus. It was Christmastide and
the father, in order to test the child’s credulity, put his own
pocket-knife into the stocking which Santa Claus was
supposed to fill. The child, though he knew his father’s
knife very well, did not in the least suspect that the knife
he found in the stocking had been placed there by human
hands, but expressed himself as pleased that Santa Claus
had sent him one like his father’s. When his father followed
this up by telling him that he had lost his knife, and by
searching for it in the boy’s presence, the latter asked
whether Santa Claus had stolen the knife—thus showing
how its close similarity to the knife he had received had
impressed him, though he would not for a moment doubt
the fact of its coming from the mysterious personage. It
might be thought that this child was particularly stupid.
On the contrary he was well above the average in intelligence.
In proof of this I may relate that the Christmas
before this, that is to say when he was under five years, he
was the only one among thirty children who recognised
his uncle when extremely well disguised as Father Christmas.
When asked by his father why he thought it was his
uncle, he said at first he didn’t know, but thinking a
moment he added, “I don’t see who else there is,” showing
that he had reasoned out his belief by a method of exclusion.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of course it will be said that I am here selecting exceptional
cases of childish imagination. I am quite ready to
admit the probability of this. The best examples of any
trait of the young mind will obviously be supplied by those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>who have most of this trait. Yet I very much suspect that
ordinary and even dull children are wont to hide away a
good deal of such superstitious belief. “One of the greatest
pleasures of childhood,” says Oliver Wendell Holmes in
<cite>The Poet of the Breakfast Table</cite>, “is found in the mysteries
which it hides from the scepticism of the elders and works
up into small mythologies of its own.”</p>

<p class='c001'>I have treated the myths of children as a product of
pure imagination, of the impulse to realise in vivid images
what lies away from and above the world of sense. Yet,
as we shall see later, they are really more than this.
They contain, like the myths of primitive man, a true
germ of thought.</p>

<p class='c001'>In George Sand’s recollections we shall meet with a
striking illustration of how the vivid imagination of supernatural
beings is followed up by a reflective and half-scientific
effort to connect the myth with the facts and laws of the
known world. This infusion of childish reason into wonderland,
the first crude attempt to adjust belief to belief, and
to find points of attachment for the much-loved myth in
the matter-of-fact world, is apt to lead, as we shall see, to
a good deal that is very quaint and characteristic in the
child’s mythology.</p>

<p class='c001'>The conclusion which observation of children leads us
to is that, as compared with adults, they are endowed with
strong imaginative power, the activity of which leads to a
surprisingly intense inner realisation of what lies above
sense. For the child, as for primitive man, reality is a projection
of fancy as well as an assurance of sense.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now this conclusion is, I think, greatly strengthened by
all that we know of the conditions of the brain-life in
children, and of the many perturbations to which it is
liable. With respect to this brain-life we have to remember
that in the first years the higher cortical centres which take
part in the co-ordinative and regulative processes of thought
and volition are but very imperfectly developed. Hence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>the centres concerned in imagination—which, if not identical
with what used to be called the sensorium or seat of
sensation, are in closest connexion with it—are not
checked and inhibited by the action of the higher centres
as is the case with us. By exercising a volitional control
over the flow of our ideas, we are able to reason away a
fancy, and generally to guard ourselves against error. In
young children all ideas that grow clear and full under the
stimulus of a strong interest are apt to persist and to become
preternaturally vivid. As has been suggested by more than
one recent writer on childhood and education, the brain
of a child has a slight measure of that susceptibility to
powerful illusory suggestion which characterises the brain
of a hypnotised subject. Savages, who show so striking a
resemblance to children in the vivacity and the dominance
of their fancy, are probably much nearer to the child than
to the civilised adult in the condition of their brain.</p>

<p class='c001'>This preternatural liveliness of the images of the
imperfectly developed brain exposes children, as we know,
to disturbing illusion. The effect of bad dreams, of intense
feeling, particularly of fear, in developing illusory belief
in sensitive and delicate children is familiar enough, and
will be dealt with again later on. Some parents feel the
dangers of such disturbance so keenly that they think it
best to cut their children off from the world of fiction
altogether. But this is surely an error. For one thing
children who are strongly imaginative will be certain to
indulge their fancies, as the Brontë girls did, even when
no fiction is supplied and their eager little minds are
thrown on the matter-of-fact newspaper. A child needs
not to be deprived of story altogether, but to be supplied
with bright and happy stories, in which the gruesome element
is subordinate. Specially sensitive children should,
I think, be guarded against much that from an older point
of view is classic, as some of the ‘creepy’ stories in Grimm,
though there are no doubt hardy young nerves which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>can thrill enjoyably under these horrors. As to confusing
a child’s sense of truth by indulging him in story, the evil
seems to me problematic, and, if it exists at all, only slight
and temporary. But I hope to touch on this aspect of the
subject in the next chapter.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>III. <br /> THE DAWN OF REASON.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c017'><i>The Process of Thought.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>To treat the child’s mind as merely a harbourer of fancies,
as completely subject to the illusive spell of its bright
imagery, would be the grossest injustice. It is one of the
reputable characteristics of childhood that it manages to
combine with so much vivacity and force of imagination
a perfectly grave matter-of-fact look-out on the actual
world.</p>

<p class='c001'>And here I should like to correct the common supposition
that children are imaginative <em>or</em> observant of their
surroundings, but not both. I have no doubt that there are
many children who show a marked preponderance of the
one or of the other tendency: there is the fanciful and
dreamy child, and the matter-of-fact child with a tenacious
grasp on the realities of things. I have but little doubt,
too, that in the case of children who show the two tendencies,
the one or the other is apt to preponderate at a certain
stage of development: many boys, for example, have their
dreamy period, and then become almost stolidly practical.
All that I am concerned to make out here is that the two
tendencies do co-exist, and as a number of parents have
assured me may co-exist each in a high degree of intensity
in the same child; the really intelligent children, boys as
well as girls, being dispassionate and shrewd inquirers into
the make of the actual world while ardently engaged in
fashioning a brighter one.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>The two tendencies belong to two moods, one of which
may be regent for days together, though they often alternate
with astonishing rapidity. More particularly the
serious matter-of-fact mood readily passes, as if in relief
from mental tension, into the playful fanciful one, as when
the tiny student, deep in the stupendous lore of the
spelling-book, suddenly dashes off to some fanciful conceit
suggested by the ‘funny’ look of a particular word or
letter.</p>

<p class='c001'>The child not only observes but begins to reflect on
what he observes, and does his best to understand the
puzzling scene which meets his eye. And all this gives
seriousness, a deep and admirable seriousness, to his
attitude. So much is this the case that if we were called on
to portray the typical mental posture of the child we
might probably do so by drawing the erect little figure of a
boy, as with widely open eye he gazes at some new wonder,
or listens to some new report of his surroundings from a
mother’s lips. Hence, one may forgive the touch of
exaggeration when Mr. Bret Harte writes: “All those
who have made a loving study of the young human animal
will, I think, admit that its dominant expression is <em>gravity</em>
and not playfulness”.<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c011'><sup>[37]</sup></a> We may now turn to this graver
side of the young intelligence.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here, again, I may as well say that I prefer to observe
the phenomenon in its clearer and fuller manifestations,
that is to say, to study the serious intelligence of the child
in the most intelligent children, or at least in children
whose minds are most active. This does not mean that
we shall be on the look-out for precocious wisdom or
priggish smartness. On the contrary, since it is childish
intelligence as such that we are in search of, we shall take
pains to avoid as far as possible any encounter with prodigies.
By these I mean the unfortunate little people whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>mental limbs have been twisted out of beautiful child-shape
by the hands of those in whom the better instincts
of the parent have been outweighed by the ambition of
the showman. We shall seek more particularly for spontaneous
openings of the mental flower under the warming
rays of a true mother’s love, for confidential whisperings of
child-thought to her ever-attentive and ever-tolerant ear.</p>

<p class='c001'>In order fully to understand the serious work of childish
intelligence, we ought to begin with a study of early observation.
But I must pass by this interesting subject with
only a remark or two.</p>

<p class='c001'>Much has been written on the deeply concentrated all-absorbing
scrutiny of things by the young eye. But to
say how much an infant of nine months really sees when
he fixes his wide eyes on some new object, is a matter of
great uncertainty. What seems certain, is that the infant
has to learn to see things, and very probably takes what
seems to us an unnecessarily long time to see them at all
completely.</p>

<p class='c001'>We find when the child grows and can give an
account of what he notes that his observation, while
often surprisingly minute in particular directions, is highly
restricted as to its directions, being narrowly confined
within the limits of a few dominant attractions. Thus a
child will sometimes be so impressed with the colour of an
object as almost to ignore its form. A little girl of
eighteen months, who knew lambs and called them
‘lammies,’ on seeing two black ones in a field among
some white ones called out, “Eh! doggie, doggie!” The
likeness of colour to the black dog overpowered the likeness
in form to the other lambs close by. Within
the limits of form-perception again, we may remark
the tendency to a one-sided mode of observing things
which has in it something of an abstract quality. For
the child C. the pointed head was the main essential
feature of the dog, and he recognised this in a bit of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>biscuit. We shall find further examples of this abstract
observation when we come to consider children’s drawings.</p>

<p class='c001'>This same partiality of observation comes out very
clearly in a good deal of the early assimilation or apperception
already referred to. The reason why it is so easy
for a child to superimpose a fanciful analogy on an object
of sense, is that his mind is untroubled by all the complexity
of this object. It fastens on some salient feature
of supreme attractiveness or interest, and flies away on the
wings of this, to what seems to us a far-off resemblance.</p>

<p class='c001'>This detaching or selective activity in children’s observation,
which in a manner is a defect, is also a point of
superiority. It has this in common with the observation
of the poet, that it is wholly engrossed with what is valuable.
Thus one main feature of the eye-lid is certainly
that it opens and closes like a curtain; and it is its resemblance
to the mysterious curtain shutting out the
daylight, which makes it a matter of absorbing interest.
Here, then, we have, as we shall see more fully presently,
a true germ of thought-activity embedded in the very process
of childish observation and recognition. For thought is
precisely a more methodical process of bringing the concrete
object into its relations to other things.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet children’s observation does not remain at this
height of grand selectiveness. The pressure of practical
needs tends to bring it down to our familiar level. A child
finds himself compelled to distinguish things and name
them as others do. The lamb and the dog, for example,
have to be distinguished by a <em>complex</em> of marks in which
the supremely interesting detail of colour holds a quite
subordinate place. Individual things, too, have to be distinguished,
if only for the purpose of drawing the line
between what is ‘mine’ and ‘not mine’. The boy’s mother,
his cup, his hat, must be readily recognised, and this necessity
forces the attention to grasp a plurality of marks.
Thus the mother cannot always be recognised by her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>height alone, as when she happens to be sitting, nor by her
hair alone, as when she happens to have her hat on, so that
the weighty problem of recognising her always compels the
child to note a number of distinctive marks, some of which
will in every case be available.</p>

<p class='c001'>When once the eye has begun to note differences it
makes rapid progress. This is particularly true where the
development of a special interest in a group of things leads
to a habit of concentration. Thus little boys when the
‘railway interest’ seizes them are apt to be finely observant
of the differences between this and that engine and so forth.
A boy aged two years and eleven months, after travelling
from Dublin to Cork, and thence by another railway, asked
his mother if she had noticed the difference in the make of
the rails on the two lines. Of course she had not, though
she afterwards ascertained that there was a slight difference
which the boy’s keener eye had detected.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fineness of a child’s distinguishing observation is
well illustrated in his recognition of small drawings and
photographs, as when a child of two will pick out the likeness
of his father from a small <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>carte de visite</i></span> group. But
this side of children’s recognition will occupy us later on.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such fine and ready recognition as that just illustrated
shows not merely a penetrating observation of what is
distinctive and characteristic, but also a measure of a higher
power, that of seizing in one act of attention a complex or
group of such marks. In truth, children’s observation, when
close and methodical, as it is apt to be under the stimulus
of a powerful interest, is often surprisingly full as well as
exact. The boy, John Ruskin, was not the only one who
could look for hours together at such an object as flowing
water, noting all its changing features. A mother writes
to me that her boy, when three and a half years old, received
a picture-book, ‘The Railway Train,’ and looked
at it almost uninterruptedly for a week, retaining it even at
<a id='corr68.36'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='meals'>meals.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_68.36'><ins class='correction' title='meals'>meals.</ins></a></span> “At the end of this time he had grasped the smallest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>detail in every picture.” By such occasional fits of fine
exhaustive inspection, a child of the more intelligent sort
will now and again come surprisingly near that higher type
of observation, at once minute and comprehensive, which
subserves, in somewhat different ways, scientific discovery
and artistic representation. Many parents when watching
these exceptional heights of childish scrutiny have indulged
in fond dreams of future greatness. Yet these achievements
are, alas, often limited to a certain stage of intellectual progress,
and are apt to disappear when the bookish days come
on, and the child loses himself hours together over his favourite
stories. And in any case the germ of promise must possess
a wondrous vitality if it resists all the efforts of our
school-system to weed out from the garden of the mind
anything so profitless as an observing faculty.</p>

<p class='c001'>Next to this work of observation we must include in
the pre-conditions of childish thought at its best a lively
retention of what is observed. Everybody who has talked
much with little children must have been struck by the
tenacity of their memories, their power of recalling after
considerable intervals small features of an object or small
incidents which others hardly noted, or, if they noted them at
the time, have since forgotten. Stories of this surprising recollection
may be obtained in abundance. A little girl when
only nine months old was on a walk shown some lambs at
the gate of a field. On being taken the same road three
weeks later she surprised her mother by calling out just
before arriving at the gate ‘Baa, baa!’ Later on children
will remember through much longer intervals. A little boy
aged two years and ten months when taken to Italy a
second time after four or five months’ absence, remembered
the smallest details, <i>e.g.</i>, how the grapes were cut, how the
wine was made and so forth.</p>

<p class='c001'>The gradual gathering of a store of such clear memory-images
is a necessary preliminary to reflexion and thought.
It is because the child remembers as well as sees, remembering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>even while he sees, that he grows thoughtful, inquiring
about the meaning and reason of this and that, or boldly
venturing on some explanation of his own. And just as
the child’s mind must take on many pictures of things before
it reflects upon and tries to understand the world, so it
must collect and arrange pictures of the successive scenes
and events of its life, before it will grow self conscious and
reflect upon its own strange existence.</p>

<p class='c001'>The only other pre-condition of this primitive thoughtfulness
is that imaginative activity which we have already
considered on its playful and pleasurable side. We are
learning at last that the inventive phantasy of a child,
prodigal as it is of delightful illusions, is also a valuable
contributor to this sober work of thought. It is just
because the young mind is so mobile and agile, passing far
beyond the narrow confines of the actual in imaginative
conjecture of what lies hidden in the remote, that it begins
to <em>think</em>, that is, to reason about the causes of things. In
the history of the individual as of the race, thought, even
the abstract thought of science, grows out of the free play
of imagination. The myth is at once a picturesque fancy,
and a crude attempt at an explanation. This primitive
thought is indeed so compact of bright picturesque imagery
that we with our scientifically trained minds might easily
overlook its inherent thoughtfulness. Yet a close inspection
shows us that it contains the essential characteristics of
thought, an impulse to comprehend things, to reduce the
confusing multiplicity to order and system.</p>

<p class='c001'>We must not hope to trace clearly the lines of this first
child-thought. The earliest attitude of the wakening intelligence
towards the confusion of novelties, which for us
has become a world, is presumably indescribable, and
further, by the time that a child comes to the use of words
and can communicate his thoughts, in a broken way at least,
the scene is already losing something of its first strangeness,
the organising work of experience has begun. Yet though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>we cannot expect to get back to the primal wonderment we
can catch glimpses of that later wonderment which arises
when instruction supplements the senses, and ideas begin
to form themselves of a vast unknown in space and time,
of the changefulness of things, and of that mystery of
mysteries the beginning of things. The study of this
child-thought as it tries to utter itself in our clumsy speech
will well repay us. Only we must be ever on the alert lest
we read too much into these early utterances, forgetting
that the child’s first tentative use of words is very apt to
mislead.</p>

<p class='c001'>The child first dimly reveals himself as thinker in the
practical domain. In the evolution of the race the reasoning
faculty has been first quickened into action by
the ferment of instinctive craving and striving. Man
began to reflect on the connexions of things in order to
supply himself with food, to ward off cold and other evils.
So with the child. Before the age of speech we may observe
him thinking out rapidly as occasion arises some
new practical expedient, as, for example, seizing a clothes-pin
or other available aid in order to reach a toy that has
slipped out of his reach; or clutching at our dress
and pulling the chair by way of signifying to us that we
are to remain and continue to amuse him. The observations
of the first months of child-life abound with such
illustrations of an initiating practical intelligence.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet these exploits, impressive as they often are, hardly
disclose the distinctive attributes of the human thinker.
The cat, without any example to imitate, will find its way
to a quite charming begging gesture by reaching up and
tapping your arm.</p>

<p class='c001'>Probably the earliest unambiguous indication of a
human faculty of thought is to be found in infantile comparison.
When a baby turns its head deliberately and
sagely from a mirror-reflexion or portrait of its mother to
the original, we appear to see the first crude beginnings of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>a process which, when more elaborated, becomes human
understanding.</p>

<p class='c001'>A good deal of comparison of this kind seems to enter
into the mental activity of young children. Thus the deep
absorbing attention to pictures spoken of above commonly
means a careful comparison of this and that form one with
another, and in certain cases, at least, a comparison of what
is now seen with the mental image of the original. In
some children, moreover, comparison under the form of
measurement grows into a sort of craze. They want to
measure the height of things one with another and so forth.
An intelligent child will even find his way to a <em>mediate</em>
form of comparison, that is, to measuring things through the
medium of a third thing. Thus a boy of five, who had
conceived a strong liking for dogs, was in the habit when
walking out of measuring on his body how high a dog
reached. On returning home he would compare this height
with that of the seat or back of a chair, and would finally
ask for a yard measure and find out the number of inches.</p>

<p class='c001'>This comparison of things is of the very essence of
understanding, of comprehending things as distinguished
from merely apprehending them as concrete isolated objects.
The child in his desire to assimilate, to find something
in the region of the known with which the new and
strange thing may be brought into kinship, is ever on the
look-out for likeness. Hence the analogical and half-poetical
apperception of things, the metaphorical reduction of a
thing to a prototype, as in calling a star an eye, or an eyelid
a curtain, may be said to contain the germ at once of
poetry and of science.</p>

<p class='c001'>This comparison for purposes of understanding leads
on to what psychologists call classification, or generalisation;
the bringing together and keeping before the mind of
a number of like things by help of a general name. The
child may be said to become a true thinker as soon as
he uses names intelligently, calling each thing by an
appropriate name, and so classing it with its kind.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>This power of infantile generalisation is one full of
interest and has been carefully observed. It will, however,
be more conveniently dealt with in another chapter where
we shall be specially concerned with the child’s use of
language.</p>

<p class='c001'>While thus beginning to arrange things according to
such points of likeness as he can discover, the child is
noting the connexions of things. He finds out what
belongs to a horse, to a locomotive engine, he notes when
father leaves home and returns, when the sun declines,
what accompanies and follows rain, and so forth. That
is to say, he is feeling his way to the idea of connectedness,
of regularity, of what we call uniformity or law. We now
say that the child reasons, no longer blindly or automatically
like the dog, but with a consciousness of what he is
doing. We little think how much hard work has to be got
through by the little brain before even this dim perception
of regularity is attained. In some things, no doubt, the
regularity is patent enough, and can hardly be overlooked
by the dullest of children. The connexion between the
laying of the cloth and the meal—at least in an orderly
home—is a matter which even the canine and the feline
intelligence is quite able to grasp. But when it comes to
finding out the law according to which, say, his face gets
dirty, his head aches, or people send out their invitations
to children’s parties, the matter is not so simple.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fact is that there is so large a proportion of apparent
disconnectedness and capricious irregularity in the
child’s world that it is hard to see how he would ever learn
to understand and to reason, were he not endowed with
a lively and inextinguishable impulse to connect and
simplify. Herein lies a part of the pathos of childhood. It
brings its naïve prepossession of a regular well-ordered
world, and alas, finds itself confronted with an impenetrable
tangle of disorder. How quaint it is to listen to the little
thinker, as, with untroubled brow, he begins to propound his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>beautifully simple theory of the cosmic order. An American
boy of ten who had had one cross small teacher, and
whose best teacher had been tall, accosted a new teacher
thus: “I’m afraid you’ll make a cross teacher”. His
teacher replied: “Why, am I cross?” To which he rejoined:
“No; but you are so small”. We call this hasty
generalisation. We might with equal propriety term it the
child’s innate <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span> view of things.</p>

<p class='c001'>With this eagerness to get at and formulate the law of
things is inseparably bound up the impulse to bring every
new occurrence under some general rule. Here, too, the
small thinker may only too easily slip by failing to see the
exact import and scope of the rule. We see this in the
extension of laws of human experience to the animal world.
Rules supplied by others and only vaguely understood,
more particularly moral and religious truths, lend themselves
to this kind of misapplication. The Worcester
collection of <cite>Thoughts and Reasonings of Children</cite> gives
some odd examples of such application. American children,
to judge from these examples, appear to be particularly
smart at quoting Scripture; not altogether, one suspects,
without a desire to show off, and possibly to raise a laugh.
But discounting the influence of such motives it seems
pretty clear that a child has a marvellous power of reading
his own ideas into others’ words, and so of giving them a
turn which is apt to stagger their less-gifted authors. Here
is a case. R.’s aunt said: “You are so restless, R., I can’t
hold you any longer”. R.: “Cast your burden on the Lord,
Aunty K., and He will sustain you”. The child, we are
told, was only four. He probably understood the Scripture
injunction as a useful prescription for getting rid of a
nuisance, and with the admirable impartiality of childish
logic at once applied it to himself. Other illustrations of
such misapplication will meet us when we take up the
relation of the child’s thought to language.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>
  <h3 class='c017'><i>The Questioning Age.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The child’s first vigorous effort to understand the
things about him may be roughly dated at the end of the
third year, and it is noteworthy that this synchronises with
the advent of the questioning age. The first putting of a
question occurred in the case of Preyer’s boy in the twenty-eighth
month, in that of Pollock’s girl in the twenty-third
month. But the true age of inquisitiveness when question
after question is fired off with wondrous rapidity and pertinacity
seems to be ushered in with the fourth year.</p>

<p class='c001'>A common theory peculiarly favoured by ignorant
nurses and mothers is that children’s questioning is a
studied annoyance. The child has come to the use of
words, and with all a child’s ‘cussedness’ proceeds to torment
the ears of those about him. There are signs, however,
of a change of view on this point. The fact that the
questioning follows on the heels of the reasoning impulse
might tell us that it is connected with the throes which the
young understanding has to endure in its first collision with
a tough and baffling world. The question is the outcome
of ignorance coupled with a belief in the boundless knowledge
of grown-up people. It is an attempt to add to the
scrappy, unsatisfying information about things which the
little questioner’s own observation has managed to gather,
or others’ half-understood words have succeeded in communicating.
It is the outcome of intellectual craving, of a
demand for mental food. But it is much more than an expression
of need. Just as the child’s articulate demand for
food implies that he knows what food is, and that it is
obtainable, so the question implies that the little questioner
knows what he needs, and in what direction to look for it.
The simplest form of question, <i>e.g.</i>, “What is this flower?” “this
insect?” shows that the child by a half-conscious process of
reflexion and reasoning has found his way to the truth that
things have their qualities, their belongings, their names.
Many questions, indeed, <i>e.g.</i>, ‘Has the moon wings?’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>‘Where do all the days go to?’ reveal a true process of
childish thought and have a high value as expressions of
this thought.</p>

<p class='c001'>Questioning may take various directions. A good deal
of the child’s catechising of his long-suffering mother is
prompted by thirst for fact.<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c011'><sup>[38]</sup></a> The typical form of this line
of questioning is ‘What?’ The motive here is to gain
possession of some fact which will connect itself with and
supplement a fact already known. ‘How old is Rover?’
‘Where was Rover born?’ ‘Who was his father?’ ‘What
is that dog’s name?’ ‘What sort of hair had you when
you were a little girl?’ These are samples of the questioning
activity by help of which the little inquirer tries to
make up his connected wholes, to see things with his
imagination in their proper attachment and order. And
how greedily and pertinaciously the small folk will follow
up their questioning, flying as it often looks wildly enough
from point to point, yet gathering from every answer some
new contribution to their ideas of things. A boy of three
years and nine months would thus attack his mother:
‘What does frogs eat, and mice and birds and butterflies?
and what does they do? and what is their names? What
is all their houses’ names? What does they call their
streets and places?’ etc., etc.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such questions easily appear foolish because, as in the
case just quoted, they are directed by quaint childish
fancies. The child’s anthropomorphic way of looking out
on the world leads him to assimilate animal to human
ways.</p>

<p class='c001'>One feature in this fact-gleaning kind of question is
the great store which the child sets by the name of a
thing. M. Compayré has pointed out that the form of
question: ‘What is this?’ often means, “What is it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>called?” The child’s unformulated theory seems to be
that everything has its own individual name. The little
boy just spoken of explained to his mother that he thought
all the frogs, the mice, the birds, and the butterflies had
names given to them by their mothers as he himself had.
Perhaps this was only a way of expressing the childish
idea that everything has its name, primordial and unchangeable.</p>

<p class='c001'>A second direction of this early questioning is towards
the reason and the cause of things. The typical form is
here ‘why?’ This form of inquiry occurred in the case of
Preyer’s boy at the age of two years forty-three weeks.
But it becomes the all-predominant form of question
somewhat later. Who that has tried to instruct the small
child of three or four does not know the long shrill whinelike
sound of this question? This form of question
develops naturally out of the earlier, for to give the
‘what?’ of a thing, that is its connexions, is to give its
‘why?’ that is its mode of production, its use and purpose.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nothing perhaps in child utterance is better worth
interpreting, hardly anything more difficult to interpret,
than this simple-looking little ‘why?’</p>

<p class='c001'>We ourselves perhaps do not use the word ‘why’ and
its correlative ‘because’ with one clear meaning; and the
child’s first use of the words is largely imitative. What
may be pretty safely asserted is that even in the most
parrot-like and wearisome iteration of ‘why?’ and its
equivalents ‘what for?’ etc., the child shows a dim recognition
of the truth that a thing is understandable, that
it has its reasons if only they can be found.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us in judging of this pitiless ‘why?’ try to understand
the situation of the young mind confronted by so
much that is strange and unassimilated, meeting by observation
and hearsay with new and odd occurrences every
day. The strange things standing apart from his tiny
familiar world, the wide region of the quaint and puzzling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>in animal ways, for example, stimulate the instinct to
appropriate, to master. The little thinker must try at
least to bring the new odd thing into some recognisable
relation to his familiar world. And what is more natural
than to go to the wise lips of the grown-up person for a
solution of the difficulty? The fundamental significance
of the ‘why?’ in the child’s vocabulary, then, is the necessity
of connecting new with old, of illuminating what is
strange and dark by light reflected from what is already
matter of knowledge. And a child’s ‘why?’ is often
temporarily satisfied by supplying from the region of the
familiar an analogue to the new and unclassed fact. Thus
his impulse to understand why pussy has fur, is met by
telling him that it is pussy’s hair.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is only a step further in the same direction when the
‘why?’ has to be met by supplying a general statement;
for to refer the particular to a general rule is a more
perfect and systematic kind of assimilation. Now we
know that children are very susceptible to the authority
of precedent, custom, general rule. Just as in children’s
ethics customary permission makes a thing right, so in
their logic the truth that a thing generally happens may be
said to supply a reason for its happening in a particular
case. Hence, when the much-abused nurse answers the
child’s question, ‘Why is the pavement hard?’ by saying,
‘Because pavement is always hard,’ she is perhaps less
open to the charge of giving a woman’s reason than is
sometimes said.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c011'><sup>[39]</sup></a> In sooth the child’s queries, his searchings
for explanation, are, as already suggested, prompted
by the desire for order and connectedness. And this
means that he wants the general rule to which he can
assimilate the particular and as yet isolated fact.</p>

<p class='c001'>From the first, however, the ‘why?’ and its congeners
have reference to the causal idea, to something which has
brought the new and strange thing into existence and made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>it what it is. In truth this reference to origin, to bringing
about or making, is exceedingly prominent in children’s
questionings. Nothing is more interesting to a child than
the production of things. What hours and hours does he
not spend in wondering how the pebbles, the stars, the
birds, the babies are made. This vivid interest in production
is to a considerable extent practical. It is one of the
great joys of children to be able themselves to make things,
and this desire to fashion, which is probably at first
quite immense, and befitting rather a god than a feeble
mannikin of three years, naturally leads on to inquiry
into the mode of producing. Yet from the earliest a
true speculative interest blends with this practical instinct.
Children are in the complete sense little philosophers, if
philosophy, as the ancients said, consists in knowing the
causes of things. This discovery of the cause is the
completed process of assimilation, of the reference of the
particular to a general rule or law.</p>

<p class='c001'>This inquiry into origin and mode of production
starts with the amiable presupposition that all things have
been hand-produced after the manner of household possessions.
The world is a sort of big house where everything
has been made by somebody, or at least fetched from somewhere.
This application of the anthropomorphic idea of
fashioning follows the law of all childish thought, that the
unknown is assimilated to the known. The one mode of
origin which the embryo thinker is really and directly
familiar with is the making of things. He himself makes
a respectable number of things, including these rents in his
clothes, messes on the tablecloth, and the like, which he
gets firmly imprinted on his memory by the authorities.
And, then, he takes a keen interest in watching the making
of things by others, such as puddings, clothes, houses, hayricks.
To ask, then, who made the animals, the babies, the
wind, the clouds, and so forth, is for him merely to apply
the more familiar type of causation as norm or rule.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>Similarly in all questions as to the ‘whence?’ of things, as in
asking whether babies were bought in a shop.</p>

<p class='c001'>The ‘why?’ takes on a more special meaning when the
idea of purpose becomes clear. The search now is for the
end, what philosophers call the teleological cause or reason.
When, for example, a child asks ‘Why does the wind blow?’
he means, ‘What is its object in blowing?’ or ‘Of what use
is the blowing of the wind?’</p>

<p class='c001'>The idea underlying the common form of the ‘why?’
interrogative deserves a moment’s inspection. A child’s
view of causation starts like other ideas from his most
familiar experiences. He soon finds out that his own
actions are controlled by the desire to get or to avoid
something, that, to speak in rather technical language, the
idea of the result of the action precedes and determines
this action.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have lately come across a very early, and as I think,
remarkable illustration of this form of childish thought.
A little girl already quoted, whom we will call M.,
when one year eleven months old, happened to be walking
with her mother on a windy day. At first she was delighted
at the strong boisterous wind, but then got tired
and said: ‘Wind make mamma’s hair untidy, Babba (her
own name) make mamma’s hair tidy, <em>so wind not blow
adain</em> (again)’. About three weeks later this child was
out in the rain, when she said to her mother: ‘Mamma, dy
(dry) Babba’s hands, <em>so not rain any more</em>’. What does
this curious inversion of the order of cause and effect mean?
I am disposed to think that this little girl, who was unusually
bright and intelligent, was transferring to nature’s
phenomena the forms of her own experience. When she
is disorderly, and her mother or nurse arranges her hair
or washes her hands, it is in order that she may not
continue to be disorderly. The child is envisaging the
wind and the rain as a kind of naughty child who can
be got to behave properly by effacing the effects of its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>naughtiness. In other words they are both to be deterred
from repeating what is objectionable by a visible and
striking manifestation of somebody’s objection or prohibition.
Here, it seems unmistakable, we have a projection
into nature of human purpose, of the idea of determination
of action by end: we have a form of anthropomorphism
which runs through the whole of primitive thought.</p>

<p class='c001'>It seems to follow from this that there is a stage in the
development of a child’s intelligence when questions such
as, ‘Why do the leaves fall?’ ‘Why does the thunder
make such a noise?’ are answered most satisfactorily by
a poetic fiction, by saying, for example, that the leaves are
old and tired of hanging on to the trees, and that the thunder
giant is in a particularly bad temper and making a noise.
It is perhaps permissible to make use of this fiction at
times, more especially when trying to answer the untiring
questioning about animals and their doings, a region of
existence, by the way, of which even the wisest of us knows
exceedingly little. Yet the device has its risks; and an
ill-considered piece of myth-making passed off as an
answer may find itself awkwardly confronted by that
most merciless of things, a child’s logic.</p>

<p class='c001'>We may notice something more in this early mode of
interrogation. Children are apt to think not only that
things behave in general after our manner, that their
activity is determined by some end or purpose, or that they
have their useful function, their <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>raison d’être</i></span> as we say,
but that this purpose concerns us human creatures. The
wind and the rain came and went in our little girl’s nature-theory
just to vex or out of consideration for ‘mamma’
and ‘Babba’. A little boy of two years two months sitting
on the floor one day in a bad temper looked up and saw the
sun shining and said captiously, ‘Sun not look at Hennie,’
and then more pleadingly, ‘Please, sun, not look at poor
Hennie’.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c011'><sup>[40]</sup></a> The sea, when the child C. first saw it, was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>supposed to make its disturbing noise with special reference
to his small ears. We may call this the anthropocentric
idea, the essence of which is that man is the centre of
reference, the aim or target, in all nature’s processes. This
anthropocentric tendency again is shared by the child
with the uncultured adult. Primitive man looks on wind,
rain, thunder as sent by some angry spirit, and even a
respectable English farmer tends to view these operations
of nature in much the same way. In children this anthropocentric
impulse is apt to get toned down by their
temperament, which is on the whole optimistic and decidedly
practical, into a looking out for the <em>uses</em> of things.
A boy, already quoted, once (towards the end of the fourth
year) asked his mother what the bees do. This question
he explained by adding: “What is the good of them?”
When told that they made honey he observed pertinently
enough from his teleological standpoint: “Then do they
bring it for us to eat?” This shrewd little fellow might
have made short work of some of the arguments by which
the theological optimists of the last century were wont to
‘demonstrate’ the Creator’s admirable adaptation of nature
to man’s wants.</p>

<p class='c001'>The frequency of this kind of ‘why?’ suggests that
children’s thoughts about things are penetrated with the
idea of purpose and use. This is shown too in other
ways. M. A. Binet found by questioning children that
their ideas of things are largely made up of uses. Thus,
asked what a hat is, a child answered: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Pour mettre sur
la tête”.</span> Mr. H. E. Kratz of Sioux City sends me some
answers to questions by children of five on entering a
primary school, which illustrate the same point. Thus
the question, ‘What is a tree?’ brings out the answers,
‘To make the wind blow,’ ‘To sit under,’ and so forth.</p>

<p class='c001'>Little by little this idea of a definite purpose and use
in this and that thing falls back and the child gets interested
more in the production or origination of things. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>wants to know who made the trees, the birds, the stars and
so forth. Here, though what we call efficient, as distinguished
from final, cause is recognised, anthropomorphism
survives in the idea of a maker analogous to the carpenter.
We shall see later that children habitually envisage the
deity as a fabricator.</p>

<p class='c001'>All this rage of questioning about the uses and the
origin of things is the outcome, not merely of ignorance and
curiosity, but of a deeper motive, a sense of perplexity, of
mystery or contradiction. It is not always easy to distinguish
the two types of question, yet in many cases at
least its form and the manner of putting it will tell us that
it issues from a puzzled and temporarily baffled brain. As
long as the questioning goes on briskly we may infer that
a child believes in the possibility of knowledge, and has
not sounded the deepest depths of intellectual despair. More
pathetic than the saddest of questions is the silencing of
questions by the loss of faith.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is easy to see that children must find themselves
puzzled with much which they see and hear of. The
apparent exceptions to rules don’t trouble the grown-up
persons just because as <em>recurrent</em> exceptions they seem to
take on a rule of their own. Thus adults though quite
unversed in hydrostatics would be incapable of being
puzzled by C.’s problem: why my putting my hand in
water does not make a hole in it. Similarly, though they
know nothing of animal physiology they are never troubled
by the mystery of fish breathing under water, which when
first noted by a child may come as a sort of shock. The
little boy just referred to, in his far-reaching zoological
interrogatory asked his mother: “Can they (the fish) breathe
with their moufs under water?”</p>

<p class='c001'>In his own investigations, and in getting instruction
from others, the child is frequently coming upon puzzles of
this sort. The same boy was much exercised about the
sea and where it went to. He expressed a wish to take off
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>his shoes and to walk out into the sea so as to see where
the ships go to, and was much troubled on learning that
the sea got deeper and deeper, and that if he walked out
into it he would be drowned. At first he denied the
paradox (which he at once saw) of the incoming sea going
uphill: “But, mamma, it doesn’t run up, it doesn’t run up,
so it couldn’t come up over our heads?” He was told
that this was so, and he wisely began to try to accommodate
his mind to this startling revelation. C., it will
be seen, was much exercised by this problem of the
moving mass of waters, wanting to know whether it came
half way up the world. Probably in both these cases the
idea of water rising had its uncanny alarming aspect.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is probable that the disappearance of a thing is at a
very early stage a puzzle to the infant. Later on, too, the
young mind continues to be exercised about this mystery.
Our little friend’s inquiry about the whither of the big
receding sea, “Where does the sea sim (swim) to?”
illustrates this perplexity. A child seems able to understand
the shifting of an object of moderate size from one
part of space to another, but his conception of space is
probably not large enough to permit him to realise how a
big tract of water can pass out of the visible scene into the
unseen. The child’s question, “Where does all the wind
go to?” seems to have sprung from a like inability to
picture a vast unseen realm of space.</p>

<p class='c001'>In addition to this difficulty of the disappearance of big
things, there seems to be something in the vastness, and
the infinite number of existent things perceived and
heard about, which puzzles and oppresses the young mind.
The inability to take in all the new facts leads to a kind of
resentment of their multitude. “Mother,” asked a boy of
four years, “why <em>is</em> there such a lot of things in the world
if no one knows all these things?” One cannot be quite
sure of the underlying thought here. The child may have
meant merely to protest against the production of so confusing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>a number of objects in the world. This certainly
seems to be the motive in some children’s inquiries, as when
a little girl, aged three years seven months, said: ‘Mamma,
why do there be any more days, why do there? and why
don’t we leave off eating and drinking?’ Here the burdensomeness
of mere multiplicity, of the unending procession
of days and meals, seems to be the motive. Yet it is
possible that the question about a lot of things not known
to anybody was prompted by a deeper difficulty, a dim
presentiment of Berkeley’s idealism, that things can exist
only as objects of knowledge. This surmise may seem far-fetched
to some, yet I have found what seem to me other
traces of this tendency in children. A girl of six and a
half years was talking to her father about the making of the
world. He pointed out to her the difficulty of creating
things out of nothing, showing her that when we made
things we simply fashioned materials anew. She pondered
and then said: “Perhaps the world’s a fancy”. Here
again one cannot be quite sure of the child-thought behind
the words. Yet it certainly looks like a falling back for a
moment into the dreamy mood of the idealist, that mood
in which we seem to see the solid fabric of things dissolve
into a shadowy phantasmagoria.</p>

<p class='c001'>The subject of origins is, as we know, beset with puzzles
for the childish mind. The beginnings of living things are,
of course, the great mystery. “There’s such a lot of things,”
remarked the little zoologist I have recently been quoting,
“I want to know, that you say nobody knows, mamma. I
want to know who made God, and I want to know if Pussy
has eggs to help her make ickle (little) kitties.” Finding
that this was not so, he observed: “Oh, then, I s’pose she
has to have God to help her if she doesn’t have kitties in
eggs given her to sit on”.  Another little boy, five years
old, found his way to the puzzle of the reciprocal genetic
relation of the hen and the egg, and asked his mother:
“When there <em>is</em> no egg where does the hen come from?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>When there <em>was</em> no egg, I mean, where <em>did</em> the hen come
from?” In a similar way, as we shall see in C.’s journal, a
child will puzzle his brains by asking how the first child was
suckled, or, as a little girl of four and a half years put it,
"When everybody was a baby—then who could be their
nurse—if they were all babies?" The beginnings of human
life are, as we know, a standing puzzle for the young investigator.</p>

<p class='c001'>Much of this questioning is metaphysical in that it
transcends the problems of every-day life and of science.
The child is metaphysician in the sense in which the earliest
human thinkers were metaphysicians, pushing his questioning
into the inmost nature of things, and back to their
absolute beginnings, as when he asks ‘Who made God?’ or
‘What was there before God?’<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c011'><sup>[41]</sup></a>  He has no idea yet of the
confines of human knowledge. If his mother tells him she
does not know he tenaciously clings to the idea that somebody
knows, the doctor it may be, or the clergyman—or
possibly the policeman, of whose superior knowledge one
little girl was forcibly convinced by noting that her father
once asked information of one of these stately officials.</p>

<p class='c001'>Strange, bizarre, altogether puzzling to the listener, are
some of these childish questions. A little American girl
of nine years after a pause in talk re-commenced the conversation
by asking: “Why don’t I think of something to
say?” A play recently performed in a London theatre
made precisely this appeal to others by way of getting at
one’s own motives a chief amusing feature in one of its
comical characters. Another little American girl aged
three one day left her play and her baby sister named
Edna Belle to find her mother and ask: “Mamma, why
isn’t Edna Belle me, and why ain’t I Edna Belle?”<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c011'><sup>[42]</sup></a> The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>narrator of this story adds that the child was not a daughter
of a professor of metaphysics but of practical farmer folk.
One cannot be quite sure of the precise drift of this question.
It may well have been the outcome of a new development
of self-consciousness, of a clearer awareness of the self in
its distinctness from others. A question with a much clearer
metaphysical ring about it, showing thought about the
subtlest problems, was that put by a boy of the same age:
“If I’d gone upstairs, could God make it that I hadn’t?”
This is a good example of the type of question: ‘Can he
make a thing done not to have been done?’ which according
to Erasmus was much debated by theologians.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c011'><sup>[43]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>With many children confronted with the mysteries of
God and the devil this questioning often reproduces the
directions of theological speculation. Thus the problem of
the necessity of evil is clearly recognisable in the question
once put by an American boy under eight years of age to
a priest who visited his home: “Father, why don’t God kill
the devil and then there would be no more wickedness in
the world?”</p>

<p class='c001'>All children’s questioning does not of course take this
sublime direction. Along with the tendency to push back
inquiry to the unreachable beginning of things we mark a
more modest and scientific line of investigation into the
observable and explainable processes of nature. Some
questions which a busy listener would pooh-pooh as dreamy
have a genuinely scientific value, showing that the little
inquirer is trying to work out some problem of fact. This
is illustrated by a question put by a little boy aged three
years nine months: “Why don’t we see two things with
our two eyes?” a problem which, as we know, has exercised
older psychologists.</p>

<p class='c001'>When this more definitely scientific direction is taken
by a child’s questioning we may observe that the ambitious
‘why?’ begins to play a second <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>rôle</i></span>, the first being now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>taken by the more modest ‘how?’ The germ of this kind
of inquiry may be present in some of the early questioning
about growth. “How,” asked our little zoologist,
“does plants grow when we plant them, and how does
boys grow from babies to big boys like me? Has I grown
now whilst I was eating my supper? See!” and he stood
up to make the most of his stature. Clearer evidence of a
directing of inquiry into the processes of things appears in
the fifth and sixth years. A little girl of four years seven
months among other questionings wanted to know what
makes the trains move, and how we move our eyes. The
incessant inquiries of the boy Clark Maxwell into the ‘go’
of this thing or the ‘particular go’ of that illustrate in a
clearer manner the early tendency to direct questioning to
the more manageable problems to which science confines
itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>These different lines of questioning are apt to run on
concurrently from the end of the third year, a fit of eager
curiosity about animals or other natural objects giving place
to a fit of theological inquiry, this again being dropped
for an equally eager inquiry into the making of clocks, railway
engines, and so on. Yet through these alternating
bouts of questioning we can distinguish something like a
law of intellectual progress. Questioning as the most direct
expression of a child’s curiosity follows the development of
his groups of ideas and of the interests which help to construct
these. Thus I think it a general rule that questioning
about the make or mechanism of things follows questioning
about animal ways just because the zoological interest (in
a very crude form of course) precedes the mechanical. The
scope of this early questioning will, moreover, expand with
intellectual capacity, and more particularly the capability
of forming the more abstruse kind of childish idea. Thus
inquiries into absolute beginnings, into the origin of the
world and of God himself, indicate the presence of a larger
intellectual grasp of time-relations and of the processes of
becoming.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>Our survey of the field of childish questioning suggests
that it is by no means an easy matter to deal with. It
must be admitted, I think, by the most enthusiastic partisan
of children that their questioning is of very unequal value.
It may often be noticed that a child’s ‘why?’ is used in a
sleepy mechanical way with no real desire for knowledge,
any semblance of answer being accepted without an attempt
to put a meaning into it. A good deal of the more
importunate kind of children’s questioning, when they
follow up question by question recklessly, as it seems, and
without definite aim, appears to be of this formal and lifeless
character, an expression not of a healthy intellectual
activity, but merely of a mood of general mental discontent
and peevishness. In a certain amount of childish questioning,
indeed, we have, I suspect, to do with a distinctly
abnormal mental state, with an analogue of that mania
of questions, or passion for mental rummaging or prying
into everything, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“Grubelsucht”</span> as the Germans call it, which
is a well-known phase of mental disease, and prompts
the patient to put such questions as this: “Why
do I stand here where I stand?” “Why is a glass a glass,
a chair a chair?” Such questioning ought, it is evident,
not to be treated too seriously. We may attach too much
significance to a child’s question, labouring hard to grasp
its meaning, with a view to answering it, when we should
be wiser if we viewed it as a symptom of mental irritability
and peevishness, to be got rid of as quickly as possible by
a good romp or other healthy distraction.<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c011'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>To admit, however, that children’s questions may now
and again need this sort of wholesome snubbing is far
from saying that we ought to treat all their questioning
with a mild contempt. The little questioners flatter us by
attributing superior knowledge to us, and good manners
should compel us to treat their questions with some attention.
And if now and then they torment us with a string of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>random reckless questioning, in how many cases, one
wonders, are they not made to suffer, and that wrongfully,
by having perfectly serious questions rudely cast back on
their hands? The truth is that to understand and to
answer children’s questions is a considerable art, including
both a large and deep knowledge of things, and a quick sympathetic
insight into the little questioners’ minds, and few of
us have at once the intellectual and the moral excellences
needed for an adequate treatment of them. It is one of the
tragi-comic features of human life that the ardent little
explorer looking out with wide-eyed wonder upon his new
world should now and again find as his first guide a nurse
or even a mother who will resent the majority of his questions
as disturbing the luxurious mood of indolence in
which she chooses to pass her days. We can never know
how much valuable mental activity has been checked, how
much hope and courage cast down by this kind of treatment.
Yet happily the questioning impulse is not easily
eradicated, and a child who has suffered at the outset from
this wholesale contempt may be fortunate enough to meet,
while the spirit of investigation is still upon him, one who
knows and who has the good nature and the patience to
impart what he knows in response to a child’s appeal.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>IV. <br /> PRODUCTS OF CHILD-THOUGHT.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c017'><i>The Child’s Thoughts about Nature.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>We have seen in the previous article how a child’s mind
behaves when brought face to face with the unknown. We
will now examine some of the more interesting results of
this early thought-activity, what are known as the characteristic
ideas of children. There is no doubt, I think,
that children, by reflecting on what they see or otherwise
experience and what they are told by others, fashion
their own ideas about nature, death and the rest. This
tendency, as pointed out above, discloses itself to some
extent in their questions about things. It has now to be
more fully studied in their sayings as a whole. The ideas
thus formed will probably prove to vary considerably
in the case of different children, yet to preserve throughout
these variations a certain general character.</p>

<p class='c001'>These ideas, moreover, like those of primitive races, will
be found to be a crude attempt at a connected system. We
must not, of course, expect too much here. The earliest
thought of mankind about nature and the supernatural was
very far from being elaborated into a consistent logical
whole; yet we can see general forms of conception or
tendencies of thought running through the whole. So in
the case of this largely spontaneous child-thought. It will
disclose to an unsparing critical inspection vast gaps, and
many unsurmounted contradictions. Thus in the case of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>children, as in that of uncultured races, the supernatural
realm is at first brought at most into only a very loose connexion
with the visible world. All the same there is seen,
in the measure of the individual child’s intelligence, the
endeavour to co-ordinate, and the poor little hard-pressed
brain of a child will often pluckily do its best in trying to
bring some connexion into that congeries of disconnected
worlds into which he finds himself so confusingly introduced,
partly by the motley character of his own experiences,
as the alternations of waking and sleeping, partly
by the haphazard miscellaneous instruction, mythological,
historical, theological, and the rest, with which we inconsiderately
burden his mind.</p>

<p class='c001'>As was observed in dealing with children’s imaginative
activity, this primitive child-lore, like its prototype in folk-lore,
is largely a product of a naïve vivid fancy. In assigning
the relations of things and their reasons, a child’s mind
does not make use of abstract conceptions. It does not
talk about “relation,” but pictures out the particular relation
it wants to express by a figurative expression, as
in apperceiving the juxtaposition of moon and star as
mamma and baby. So it does not talk of abstract force,
but figures some concrete form of agency, as in explaining
the wind by the idea of somebody’s waving a big fan
somewhere. This first crude attempt of the child to
envisage the world is, indeed, largely mythological, proceeding
by the invention of concrete and highly pictorial
ideas of fairies, giants and their doings.</p>

<p class='c001'>The element of thought comes in with the recognition
of the real as such, and with the application of the products
of young phantasy to comprehending and explaining this
reality. And here we see how this primitive child-thought,
though it remains instinct with glowing imagery, differentiates
itself from pure fancy. This last knows no
restraint, and aims only at the delight of its spontaneous
play-like movements, whereas thought is essentially the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>serious work of realising and understanding what exists.
The contrast is seen plainly enough if we compare the
mental attitude of the child when he is frankly romancing,
giving out now and again a laugh, which shows that he
himself fully recognises the absurdity of his talk, with his
attitude when in gravest of moods he is calling upon his
fancy to aid reason in explaining some puzzling fact.</p>

<p class='c001'>How early this splitting of the child’s imaginative
activity into these two forms, the playful and the thoughtful,
takes place is not, I think, very easy to determine.
Many children at least are apt at first to take all that is
told them as gospel. To most of them about the age of
three and four, I suspect, fairyland, if imagined at all, is
as much a reality as the visible world. The disparity of
its contents, the fairies, dragons and the rest, with those
of the world of sense does not trouble their mind, the two
worlds not being as yet mentally juxtaposed and dove-tailed
one into the other. It is only later when the desire
to understand overtakes and even passes the impulse to
frame bright and striking images, and, as a result of this,
critical reflexion applies itself to the nursery legends and
detects their incongruity with the world of every-day perception,
that a clear distinction comes to be drawn between
reality and fiction, what exists and can (or might) be
verified by sense, and what is only pictured by the mind.</p>

<p class='c001'>With this preliminary peep into the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>modus operandi</i></span> of
children’s thought, let us see what sort of ideas of things
they fashion.</p>

<p class='c001'>Beginning with their ideas of natural objects we find, as
has been hinted, the influence of certain predominant tendencies.
Of these the most important is the impulse to think
of what is far off, whether in space or time, and so unobservable,
as like what is near and observed. Along with this
tendency, or rather as one particular development of it,
there goes the disposition already illustrated, to vivify
nature, to personify things and so to assimilate their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>behaviour to the child’s own, and to explain the origin of
things by ideas of making and aiming at some purpose.
Since, at the same time that these tendencies are still
dominant, the child by his own observation and by such
instruction as he gets, is gaining insight into the ‘how,’ the
mechanism of things, we find that his cosmology is apt to
be a quaint jumble of the scientific and the mythological.
Thus the boy C. tried to conceive of the divine creation of
men as a mechanical process with well-marked stages—the
fashioning of stone men, iron men, and then real men.
In many cases we can see that a nature-myth comes in to eke
out the deficiencies of mechanical insight. Thus, the production
of thunder and other strange and inexplicable
phenomena is referred, as by the savage, and even by many
so-called civilised men and women, to the direct interposition
of a supernatural agency. The theological idea with
which children are supplied is apt to shape itself into that
of a capricious and awfully clever demiurgos, who not only
made the world-machine but alters its working as often
as he is disposed. With this idea of a supernatural
agent there is commonly combined that of a natural process
as means employed, as when thunder is supposed to be
caused by God’s treading heavily on the floor of the sky.
Contradictions are not infrequent, the mythological impulse
sometimes alternating with a more distinctly scientific impulse
to grasp the mechanical process, as when wind is sometimes
thought of, as caused by a big fan, and sometimes, <i>e.g.</i>,
when heard moaning in the night, endowed with life and
feeling.</p>

<p class='c001'>I shall make no attempt to give a methodical account
of children’s thoughts about nature. I suspect that a good
deal more material will have to be collected before a complete
description of these thoughts is possible. I shall
content myself with giving a few samples of their ideas so
far as my own studies have thrown light on them.</p>

<p class='c001'>With respect to the make or substance of things children
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>are, I believe, disposed to regard all that they see as having
the resistant quality of solid material substance.</p>

<p class='c001'>At first, that is to say after the child has had experience
enough of seeing and touching things at the same time to
know that the two commonly go together, he believes that
all which he sees is tangible or substantial. Thus he will
try to touch shadows, sunlight dancing on the wall, and
picture forms. This tendency to “reify,” or make things of,
his visual impressions shows itself in pretty forms, as when
the little girl M., one year eleven months old, “gathered sunlight
in her hands and put it on her face”. The same child
about a month earlier expressed a wish to wash some black
smoke. This was the same child that tried to make the
wind behave by making her mother’s hair tidy; and her
belief in the material reality of the wind was shown by her
asking her mother to lift her up high so that she might see
the wind. This last, it is to be noted, was an inference from
touching and resisting to seeing.<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c011'><sup>[45]</sup></a> Wind, it has been well
remarked, keeps something of its substantiality for all of
us long after shadows have become the type of unreality,
proving that the experience of resisting something lies at
the root of our sense of material substance. That older
children believe in the wind as a living thing seems suggested
by the readiness with which they get up a kind of play-tussle
with it. That wind even in less fanciful moments is
reified is suggested by the following story from the Worcester
collection. A girl aged nine was looking out and seeing
the wind driving the snow in the direction of a particular
town, Milbury: whereupon she remarked, “I’d like to live
down in Milbury”. Asked why, she replied, “There must
be a lot of wind down there, it’s all blowing that way”.</p>

<p class='c001'>Children, as may be seen in this story, are particularly
interested in the movements of things. Movement is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>clearest and most impressive manifestation of life. All
apparently spontaneous or self-caused movements are accordingly
taken by children, as by primitive man, to be the
sign of life, the outcome of something analogous to their
own impulses. Hence the movements of falling leaves, of
running water, of feathers and the like are specially suggestive
of life. Wind owes much of its vitality, as seen in
the facile personification of it by the poet, to its apparently
uncaused movements. Some children in the Infant Department
of a London Board School were asked what things
in the room were alive, and they promptly replied the
smoke and the fire. Big things moving by an internal
mechanism of which the child knows nothing, more especially
engines, are of course endowed with life. A little girl
of thirteen months offered a biscuit to a steam-tram, and
the author of <cite>The Invisible Playmate</cite> tells us that his little
girl wanted to stroke the “dear head” of a locomotive. A
child has been known to ask whether a steam-engine was
alive. In like manner, savages on first seeing the self-moving
steamer take it for a big animal. The fear of a dog
at the sight of an unfamiliar object appearing to move of
itself, as a parasol blown along the ground by the wind,
seems to imply a rudiment of the same impulse to interpret
self-movement as a sign of life.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c011'><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The child’s impulse to give life to moving things may
lead him to overlook the fact that the movement is caused
by an external force, and this even when the force is
exerted by himself. The boy C. on finding the cushion
he was sitting upon slipping from under him in consequence
of his own wriggling movements pronounced it alive. In
like manner children, as suggested above, ascribe life to
their moving playthings. Thus, C.’s sister when five years
old stopped one day trundling her hoop, and turning to
her mother, exclaimed: “Ma, I do think this hoop must
be alive, it is so sensible: it goes where I want it to”.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>Another little girl two and a quarter years old on having
a string attached to a ball put into her hand, and after
swinging it round mechanically, began to notice the movement
of the ball, and said to herself, “Funny ball!” In both
these cases, although the movement was directly caused by
the child, it was certainly in the first case, and apparently
in the second, attributed to the object.</p>

<p class='c001'>Next to movement apparently spontaneous sound
appears to be a common reason for attributing life to
inanimate objects. Are not movement and vocal sound the
two great channels of utterance of the child’s own impulses?
The little girl M., when just two years old, being asked
by her mother for a kiss, answered prettily, ‘Tiss
(kiss) gone away’. This may, of course, have been
merely a child’s way of using language, but the fact that
the same little girl asked to see a ‘knock’ suggests that
she was disposed to give reality and life to sounds. Its sound
greatly helps the persuasion that the wind is alive. A
little boy assured his teacher that the wind was alive, for
he heard it whistling in the night. The ascription of life
to fire is probably aided by its sputtering crackling noises.
The impulse, too, to endow so little organic-looking an
object as a railway engine with conscious life is probably
supported by the knowledge of its puffing and whistling.
Pierre Loti, when as a child he first saw the sea, regarded
it as a living monster, no doubt on the ground of
its movement and its noise. The personification of the
echo by the child, of which George Sand’s reminiscences
give an excellent example, as also by uncultured man, is
a signal illustration of the suggestive force of a voice-like
sound.</p>

<p class='c001'>Closely connected with this impulse to ascribe life to
what older folk regard as inanimate objects is the tendency
to conceive them as growing. This is illustrated in the
remark of the boy C., that his stick would in time grow
bigger. On the other hand, there is in the Worcester Collection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>a curious story of a little American boy of three who,
having climbed up into a large waggon, and being asked,
“How are you going to get out?” replied, “I can stay
here till it gets little and then I can get out my own self”.
We shall see presently that shrinkage or diminution of size
is sometimes attributed by the child-mind to people when
getting old. So that we seem to have in each of these
cases the extension to things generally of an idea first
formed in connexion with the observation of human life.</p>

<p class='c001'>Children’s ideas of natural objects are anthropomorphic,
not merely as reflecting their own life, but as modelled
after the analogy of the effects of their action. Quite
young children are apt to extend the ideas broken and
mended to objects generally. Anything which seems to
have become reduced by losing a portion of itself is said to
be ‘broken’. A little boy of three, on seeing the moon
partly covered by a cloud, remarked, “The moon is broken”.
On the other hand, in the case of one little boy, everything
intact was said to be mended. It may be said, however,
that we cannot safely infer from such analogical use of
common language that children distinctly think of all
objects as undergoing breakage and repair: for these expressions
in the child’s vocabulary may refer rather to the
resulting appearances, than to the processes by which they
are brought about.</p>

<p class='c001'>Clearer evidences of this reflexion on to nature of the
characteristics of his own life appear when a child begins
to speculate about mechanical processes, which he invariably
conceives of after the analogy of his own actions.
This was illustrated in dealing with children’s questions.
We see it still more clearly manifested in some of their
ideas. One of the most curious instances of this that I
have met with is seen in early theorisings about the cause
of wind. One of the children examined by Mr. Kratz
said the tree was to make the wind blow. A pupil of mine
distinctly recalls that when a child he accounted for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>wind at night by the swaying of two large elms in front of
the house and not far from the windows of his bedroom.
This reversing of the real order of cause and effect looks
silly, until we remember that the child necessarily looks at
movement in the light of his own actions. He moves
things, <i>e.g.</i>, the water, by his moving limbs; we set the
air in motion by a moving fan; it seems, therefore, natural
to him that the wind-movements should be caused by the
pressure of some moving thing; and there is the tree actually
seen to be moving.</p>

<p class='c001'>So far I have spoken for the most part of children’s
ideas about near and accessible objects. Their notions of
what is distant and inaccessible are, as remarked, wont to
be formed on the model of the first. Here, however, their
knowledge of things will be largely dependent on others’
information, so that the naïve impulse of childish intelligence
has, as best it may, to work under the limitations of an imperfectly
understood language.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is perhaps hardly necessary to remind the reader
that children’s ideas of distance before they begin to travel
far are necessarily very inadequate. They are disposed to
localise the distant objects they see, as the sun, moon and
stars, and the places they hear about on the earth’s surface
as near as possible. The tendency to approximate things
as seen in the infant’s stretching out of the hand to touch the
moon lives on in the later impulse to localise the sky and
heavenly bodies just beyond the farthest terrestrial object
seen, as when a child thought they were just above the
church spire, another that they could be reached by tying
a number of ladders together, another that the setting sun
went close behind the ridge of hills, and so forth. The
stars, being so much smaller looking, seem to be located
farther off than the sun and moon. Similarly when they
hear of a distant place, as India, they tend to project it just
beyond the farthest point known to them, say Hampstead,
to which they were once taken on a long, long journey from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>their East End home. A child’s standard of size and
distance is, as all know who have revisited the home of
their childhood after many years, very different from the
adult’s. To the little legs unused as yet to more than short
spells of locomotion a mile seems stupendous: and then
the half-formed brain cannot yet pile up the units of
measurement well enough to conceive of hundreds and
thousands of miles.</p>

<p class='c001'>The child appears to think of the world as a circular
plain, and of the sky as a sort of inverted bowl upon it.
C.’s sister used on looking at the sky to fancy she was inside
a blue balloon. That is to say he takes them to be what they
look. In a similar manner C. took the sun to be a great disc
which could be put on the round globe to make a ‘see-saw’.
When this ‘natural realism’ gets corrected, children go to
work to convert what is told them into an intelligible form.
Thus they begin to speculate about the other side of the
globe, and, as Mr. Barrie reminds us, are apt to fancy they
can know about it by peeping down a well. When religious
instruction introduces the new region of heaven
they are apt to localise it just above the sky, which to their
thought forms its floor. Some genuine thought-work is
seen in the effort to harmonise the various things they
learn by observation and instruction about the celestial
region into a connected whole. Thus the sky is apt to be
thought of as <em>thin</em>, this idea being probably formed for the
purpose of explaining the shining through of moon and stars.
Stars are, as we know, commonly thought of by the child
as holes in the sky letting through the light beyond. One
Boston child ingeniously applied the idea of the thinness of
the sky to explain the appearance of the moon when one
half is bright and the other faintly illumined, supposing
it to be half-way through the partially diaphanous floor.
Others again prettily accounted for the waning of the
moon to a crescent by saying it was half stuck or half
buttoned into the sky.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>The movements of the sun and other heavenly bodies
are similarly apperceived by help of ideas of movements of
familiar terrestrial objects. Thus the sun was thought by
the Boston children half-mythologically, half-mechanically,
to roll, to fly, to be blown (like a soap bubble or balloon?)
and so forth. The anthropocentric form of teleological explanation
is apt to creep in, as when a Boston child said
charmingly that the moon comes round when people forget
to light some lamps. Theological ideas, too, are pressed
into this sphere of explanation, as in the attribution of the
disappearance of the sun to God’s pulling it up higher out
of sight, to his taking it into heaven and putting it to bed,
and so forth. These ideas are pretty obviously not those
of a country child with a horizon. There is rather more of
nature-observation in the idea of another child that the sun
after setting lies under the trees where angels mind it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The impressive phenomena of thunder and lightning
give rise in the case of the child as in that of the Nature-man
to some fine myth-making. The American children, as already
observed, have different mechanical illustrations for
setting forth the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>modus</i></span> of the supernatural operation here,
thunder being thought of now as God groaning, now as his
walking heavily on the floor of heaven (<i>cf.</i> the old Norse idea
that thunder is caused by the rolling of Thor’s chariot),
now as his hammering, now as his having coals run in—ideas
which show how naïvely the child-mind humanises
the Deity, making him a respectable citizen with a house
and a coal-cellar. In like manner the lightning is attributed
to God’s burning the gas quick, striking many
matches at once, or other familiar human device for getting
a brilliant light suddenly. So God turns on rain by a
tap, or lets it down from a cistern by a hose, or, better,
passes it through a sieve or a dipper with holes.<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c011'><sup>[47]</sup></a> In like
manner a high wind was explained by a girl of five and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>half by saying that it was God’s birthday, and he had received
a trumpet as a present.</p>

<p class='c001'>Throughout the whole region of these mysterious phenomena
we have illustrations of the anthropocentric tendency
to regard what takes place as designed for us poor
mortals. The little girl of whom Mr. Canton writes thought
“the wind, and the rain and the moon ‘walking’ came out
to see <em>her</em>, and the flowers woke up with the same laudable
object”.<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c011'><sup>[48]</sup></a> When frightened by the crash of the thunder a
child instinctively thinks that it is all done to vex his little
soul. One of the funniest examples of the application of
this idea I have met with is in the Worcester Collection.
Two children, D. and K., aged ten and five respectively,
live in a small American town. D., who is reading about
an earthquake, addresses his mother thus: “Oh, isn’t it
dreadful, mamma? Do you suppose we will ever have one
here?” K., intervening with the characteristic impulse
of the young child to correct his elders: “Why, no, D., they
don’t have earthquakes in little towns like this”. There is
much to unravel in this delightful childish observation. It
looks to my mind as if the earthquake were envisaged by
the little five-year-old as a show, God being presumably the
travelling showman, who takes care to display his fearful
wonders only where there is an adequate body of spectators.</p>

<p class='c001'>Finally, the same impulse to understand the new and
strange by assimilating it to the familiar is, so far as I can
gather, seen in children’s first ideas about those puzzling
semblances of visible objects which are due to subjective
sensations. As we shall see in C.’s case the bright spectra
or after-images caused by looking at the sun are instinctively
objectived by the child, that is regarded as things
external to his body. Here is a pretty full account of a
child’s thought about these subjective optical phenomena.
A little boy of five, our little zoologist, in poor health at the
time, “constantly imagined he saw angels, and said they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>not white, that was a mistake, they were little coloured
things, light and beautiful, and they went into the toy-basket
and played with his toys”. Here we have not only
objectifying but myth-building. A year later he returned
to the subject. “He stood at the window at B. looking
out at a sea-mist thoughtfully and said suddenly, ‘Mamma,
do you remember I told you that I had seen angels?
Well, I want now to say they were not angels, though I
thought they were. I have seen it often lately, I see it
now: it is bright stars, small bright stars moving by. I
see it in the mist before that tree. I see it oftenest in the
misty days.... Perhaps by-and-by I shall think it is
something in my own eyes.’” Here we see a long and
painstaking attempt of a child’s brain to read a meaning
into the ‘flying spots,’ which many of us know though we
hardly give them a moment’s attention.</p>

<p class='c001'>What are children’s first thoughts about their dreams
like? I have not been able to collect much evidence on
this head. What seems certain is that to the simple intelligence
of the child these counterfeits of ordinary sense-presentations
are real external things. The crudest manifestation
of this thought-tendency is seen in taking the
dream-apparition to be actually present in the bedroom.
A boy in an elementary school in London, aged five years,
said one day: “Teacher, I saw an old woman one night
against my bed”. Another child, a little girl, in the same
school told her mother that she had seen a funeral last
night, and on being asked, “Where?” answered quaintly,
“I saw it in my pillow”. A little boy whom I know once
asked his mother not to put him to bed in a certain room,
“because there were so many dreams in the room”. In
thus materialising the dream and localising it in the actual
surroundings, the child but reflects the early thought of the
race which starts from the supposition that the man or
animal which appears in a dream is a material reality which
actually approaches the sleeper.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>The Nature-man, as we know from Professor Tylor’s
researches, goes on to explain dreams by his theory of souls
or ‘doubles’ (animism). Children do not often find their
way to so subtle a line of thought. Much more commonly
they pass from the first stage of acceptance of objects
present to their senses to the identification of dreamland
with the other and invisible world of fairyland. There is
little doubt that the imaginative child firmly believes in
the existence of this invisible world, keeps it apart from
the visible one, even though at times he may give it a
definite locality in this (<i>e.g.</i>, in C.’s case, the wall of the
bedroom). He gets access to it by shutting out the real
world, as when he closes his eyes tightly and ‘thinks’.
With such a child, dreams get taken up into the invisible
world. Going to sleep is now recognised as the surest way
of passing into this region. The varying colour of his
dreams, now bright and dazzling in their beauty, now black
and terrifying, may be explained by a reference to the division
of that fairy world into princes, good fairies, on the one
hand, and cruel giants, witches, and the like, on the other.</p>

<p class='c001'>We may now pass to some of children’s characteristic
ideas about living things, more particularly human beings,
and the familiar domestic animals. The most interesting
of these I think are those respecting growth and birth.</p>

<p class='c001'>As already mentioned, growth is one of the most
stimulating of childish puzzles. A child, led no doubt by
what others tell him, finds that things are in general made
bigger by additions from without, and his earliest conception
of growth is, I think, that of such addition. Thus, plants are
made to grow, that is, swell out, by the rain. The idea that
the growth or expansion of animals comes from eating is
easily reached by the childish intelligence, and, as we know,
nurses and parents have a way of recommending the less
attractive sorts of diet by telling children that they will
make them grow. The idea that the sun makes us grow,
often suggested by parents (who may be ignorant of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>fact that growth is more rapid in the summer than in the
winter), is probably interpreted by the analogy of an infusion
of something into the body.</p>

<p class='c001'>In carrying out my inquiries into this region of childish
ideas, I lighted quite unexpectedly on the queer notion that
towards the end of life there is a reverse process of shrinkage.
Old people are supposed to become little again.
The first instance of this was supplied me by the Worcester
Collection of Thoughts. A little girl of three once said to
her mother: “When I am a big girl and you are a little girl
I shall whip you just as you whipped me now”. At first
one is almost disposed to think that this child must have
heard of Mr. Anstey’s amusing story <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Vice Versâ</cite></span>. Yet this
idea seems too improbable: and I have since found that she
is not by any means the only one who has entertained this
idea. A little boy that I know, when about three and a
half years old, used often to say to his mother with perfect
seriousness of manner: “When I am big then you will be
little, then I will carry you about and dress you and put
you to sleep”.</p>

<p class='c001'>I happened to mention this fact at a meeting of mothers
and teachers, when I received further evidence of this
tendency of child-thought. One lady whom I know could
recollect quite clearly that when a little girl she was
promised by her aunt some treasures, trinkets I fancy, when
she grew up; and that she at once turned to her aunt and
promised her that she would then give her in exchange
all her dolls, as by that time she (the aunt) would be a
little girl. Another case narrated was that of a little girl of
three and a half years, who when her elder brother and
sister spoke to her about her getting big rejoined: “What
will you do when you are little?” A third case mentioned
was that of a child asking about some old person of her
acquaintance: “When will she begin to get small?” I
have since obtained corroboratory instances from parents
and teachers of infant classes. Thus a lady writes that a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>little girl, a cousin of hers aged four, to whom she was reading
something about an old woman, asked: “Do people turn
back into babies when they get quite old?”</p>

<p class='c001'>What, it may be asked, does this queer idea of shrinkage
in old age mean? By what quaint zig-zag movement
of childish thought was the notion reached? I cannot
learn that there is any such idea in primitive folk-lore, and
this suggests that children find their way to it, in part at
least, by the suggestions of older people’s words. A child
may, no doubt, notice that old people stoop, and look
small, and the fairy book with little old women may
strengthen the tendency to think of shrinkage. But I
cannot bring myself to believe that this would suffice to
produce the idea in so many cases.</p>

<p class='c001'>That there is much in what the little folk hear us say
fitted to raise in their minds an idea of shrinking back into
child-form is certain. Many children must, at some time
or another, have overheard their elders speaking of old
feeble people getting childish; and we must remember that
even the attributive ‘silly’ applied to old people might lead
a child to infer a return to childhood; for if there is one
thing that children—true unsophisticated children—believe
in it is the all-knowingness of grown-ups as contrasted
with the know-nothingness of themselves. C.’s belief in
the preternatural calculating powers of Goliath is an
example of this correlation in the child’s consciousness
between size and intelligence.<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c011'><sup>[49]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But I suspect that there is a further source of this
characteristic product of early thought, involving still more
of the child’s philosophizing. As we have seen, a child
cannot accept an absolute beginning of things, and we
shall presently find that he is equally incapable of believing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>in an absolute ending. He knows that we begin our earthly
life as babies. Well, the babies must come from something,
and when we die we must pass into something. What
more natural, then, than the idea of a rhythmical alternation
of cycles of existence, babies passing into grown-ups, and
these again into babies, and so the race kept going? Does
this seem too far-fetched an explanation? I think it will
be found less so if it is remembered that according to our way
of instructing these active little brains, people are brought
to earth as babies in angels’ arms, and that when they die
they are taken back also in angels’ arms. Now as the
angel remains of constant size,—for this their pictures vouch—it
follows that old people, when they are dead at least,
must have shrivelled up to nursable dimensions; and as
the child, when he philosophizes, knows nothing of miraculous
or cataclasmic changes, he naturally supposes that
this shrivelling up is gradual like that of flowers and other
things when they fade.<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c011'><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>I am disposed to think, then, that in this idea of senile
shrinkage we have one of the most interesting and convincing
examples of a child’s philosophizing, of his impulse
to reflect on what he sees and hears about with a view to
systematise. Yet the matter requires further observation.
Is it thoughtful, intelligent children, who excogitate this
idea? Would it be possible to get the child’s own explanation
of it before he has completely outgrown it?<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c011'><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The origin of babies and young animals furnishes the
small brain, as we have seen, with much food for speculation.
Here the little thinker is not often left to excogitate a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>theory for himself. His inconvenient questionings in this
direction have to be firmly checked, and various and truly
wonderful are the ways in which the nurse and the mother
are wont to do this. Any fiction is supposed to be good
enough for the purpose. Divine action, as remarked above,
is commonly called in, the questioner being told that
the baby has been sent down from heaven in the arms of
an angel and so forth. Fairy stories with their pretty
conceits, as that of the child Thumbkin growing out of a
flower in Hans Andersen’s book, contribute their suggestions,
and so there arises a mass of child-lore about babies
in which we can see that the main ideas are supplied by
others, though now and again we catch a glimpse of the
child’s own contributions. Thus according to Stanley
Hall’s report the Boston children said, among other things,
that God makes babies in heaven, lets them down or drops
them for the women and doctors to catch them, or that he
brings them down a wooden ladder backwards and pulls it
up again, or that mamma, nurse or doctor goes up and
fetches them in a balloon. They are said by some to grow
in cabbages or to be placed by God in water, perhaps in
the sewer, where they are found by the doctor, who takes
them to sick folks that want them. Here we have delicious
touches of childish fancy, quaint adaptations of fairy and
Bible lore, as in the use of Jacob’s ladder and of the legend
of Moses placed among the bulrushes, this last being enriched
by the thorough master-stroke of child-genius, the
idea of the dark, mysterious, wonder-producing sewer. In
spite too of all that others do to impress the traditional
notions of the nursery here, we find that a child will now
and again think out the whole subject for himself. The
little boy C. is not the only one I find who is of the opinion
that babies are got at a shop. Another little boy, I am
informed, once asked his mamma in the abrupt childish
manner, “Mamma, vere did Tommy (his own name) tum
(come) from?” and then with the equally childish way of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>sparing you the trouble of answering his question, himself
observed, quite to his own satisfaction, “Mamma did tie
(buy) Tommy in a s’op (shop)”. Another child, seeing the
announcement “Families Supplied” in a grocer’s shop,
begged his mother to get him a baby. This looks like a real
childish idea. To the young imagination the shop is a
veritable wonderland, an Eldorado of valuables, and it
appears quite reasonable to the childish intelligence that
babies like dolls and other treasures should be procurable
there.</p>

<p class='c001'>The ideas partly communicated by others, partly thought
out for themselves are carried over into the beginnings of
animal life. Thus, as we have seen, one little boy supposed
that God helps pussy to have “’ickle kitties,” seeing that she
hasn’t any kitties in eggs given her to sit upon.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><i>Psychological Ideas.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>We may now pass to some of the characteristic modes
of child-thought about that standing mystery, the self. As
our discussion of the child’s ideas of origin, growth and
final shrinkage suggests, a good deal of his most earnest
thinking is devoted to problems relating to himself.</p>

<p class='c001'>The date of the first thought about self, of the first dim
stage of self-awareness, probably varies considerably in the
case of different children according to rapidity of mental
development and circumstances. The little girl, who was
afterwards to be known as George Sand, may be supposed
to have had an exceptional development; and the accident
of infancy to which she refers as having aroused the earliest
form of self-consciousness was, of course, exceptional too.
There are probably many robust and dull children, knowing
little of life’s misery, and allowed in general to have
their own way, who have but little more of self-consciousness
than that, say, of a young, well-favoured porker.</p>

<p class='c001'>The earliest idea of self seems to be obtained by the
child through an examination by the senses of touch and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>sight of his own body. A child has been observed to study
his fingers attentively in the fourth and fifth month, and
this scrutiny goes on all through the second year and even
into the third.<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c011'><sup>[52]</sup></a> Children seem to be impressed quite early
by the fact that in laying hold of a part of the body with
the hand they get a different kind of experience from that
which they obtain when they grasp a foreign object.
Through these self-graspings, self-strikings, self-bitings,
aided by the very varied, and often extremely disagreeable
operations of the nurse and others on the surface of their
bodies, they probably reach during the first year the
idea that their body is different from all other things, is
‘me’ in the sense that it is the living seat of pain and
pleasure. The growing power of movement of limb,
especially when the crawling stage is reached, gives a
special significance to the body as that which can be
moved, and by the movements of which interesting and
highly impressive changes in the environment, <i>e.g.</i>, bangs
and other noises, can be produced.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is probable that the first ideas of the bodily self are
ill-defined. It is evident that the head and face are not
known at first as a <em>visible</em> object. The upper limbs
by their movement across the field of vision would come
in for the special notice of the eye. We know that the
baby is at an early date wont to watch its hands. The
lower limbs, moreover, seem to receive special attention
from the exploring and examining hand.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is some reason to think, however, that in spite of
these advantages, the limbs form a less integral and essential
part of the bodily self than the trunk. A child in his second
year was observed to bite his own finger till he cried with
pain. He could hardly have known it as a part of his
sensitive body. Preyer tells us of a boy of nineteen months
who when asked to give his foot seized it with both hands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>and tried to hand it over. A like facility in casting off
from the self or alienating the limbs is illustrated in a story
in the Worcester Collection of a child of three and a half
years who on finding his feet stained by some new stockings
observed: “Oh, mamma! these ain’t my feet, these ain’t
the feet I had this morning”. This readiness to detach
the limbs shows itself still more plainly in the boy C.’s
complaining when in bed and trying to wriggle into a snug
position that his legs came in the way of himself. Here the
legs seem to be half transformed into foreign persons; and
this tendency to personify the limbs seems to be further
illustrated in Laura Bridgman’s pastime of spelling a word
wrongly with one hand and then slapping that hand with
the other.</p>

<p class='c001'>Why, it may be asked, should a child attach this supreme
importance to the trunk, when his limbs are always forcing
themselves on his notice by their movements, and when he
is so deeply interested in them as the parts of the body
which do things? I suspect that the principal reason is
that a child soon learns to connect with the trunk the recurrent
and most impressive of his feelings of comfort and
discomfort, such as hunger, thirst, stomachic pains and the
corresponding reliefs. We know that the “vital sense”
forms the sensuous basis of self-consciousness in the adult,
and it is only reasonable to suppose that in the first years
of life, when it fills so large a place in the consciousness, it
has most to do with determining the idea of the sentient
or feeling body. Afterwards the observation of maimed
men and animals would confirm the idea that the trunk
is the seat and essential portion of the living body. The
language of others too by identifying ‘body’ and ‘trunk’
would strengthen the tendency.</p>

<p class='c001'>About this interesting trunk-body, what is inside it, and
how it works, the child speculates vastly. References to
the making of bone, the work of the stomach, and so forth
have to be understood somehow. It would be interesting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>to get at a child’s unadulterated view of his anatomy and
physiology. The Worcester Collection illustrates what
funny ideas a child can entertain of the mechanism of his
body. A little girl between five and six thought it was the
little hairs coming against the lids which made her sleepy.</p>

<p class='c001'>At a later stage of the child’s development, no doubt,
when he comes to form the idea of a conscious thinking
‘I,’ the head will become a principal portion of the bodily
self. In the evolution of the self-idea in the race, too, we
find that the soul was lodged in the trunk long before it
was assigned a seat in the head. As may be seen in C.’s
case children are quite capable of finding their way, partly
at least, to the idea that the soul has its lodgment in the
head. But it is long before this thought grows clear. This
may be seen in children’s talk, as when a girl of four
spoke of her dolly as having no sense in her <em>eyes</em>. Even
when a child learns from others that we think with our
brains he goes on supposing that our thoughts travel
down to the mouth when we speak.</p>

<p class='c001'>Very interesting in connexion with the first stages of
development of the idea of self is the experience of the
mirror. It would be absurd to expect a child when first
placed before a mirror to recognise his own face. He will
smile at the reflexion as early as the tenth week, though
this is probably merely an expression of pleasure at the
sight of a bright object. If held in the nurse’s or father’s
arms to a glass when about six months old a baby will at
once show that he recognises the image of the familiar face
of the latter by turning round to the real face, whereas he
does not recognise his own. He appears at first and for
some months to take it for a real object, sometimes smiling
to it as to a stranger and even kissing it, or, as in the case of a
little girl (fifteen months old), offering it things and saying
‘Ta’ (sign of acceptance). In many cases curiosity
prompts to an attempt to grasp the mirror-figure with the
hand, to turn up the glass, or to put the hand behind it in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>order to see what is really there. This is very much like
the behaviour of monkeys before a mirror, as described by
Darwin and others. Little by little the child gets used to
the reflexion, and then by noting certain agreements
between his bodily self and the image, as the movement of
his hands when he points, and partly, too, by a kind of inference
of analogy from the doubling of other things by the
mirror, he reaches the idea that the reflexion belongs to
himself. By the sixtieth week Preyer’s boy had associated
the name of his mother with her image, pointing to it when
asked where she was. By the twenty-first month he did
the same thing in the case of his own image.<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c011'><sup>[53]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>An infant will, we know, take a shadow to be a real
object and try to touch it. Some children on noticing their
own and other people’s shadows on the wall are afraid as
at something uncanny. Here, too, in time the strange
phenomenon is taken as a matter of course and referred to
the sun.</p>

<p class='c001'>We are told that the phenomena of reflexions and
shadows, along with those of dreams, had much to do with
the development, in the early thought of the race, of the
animistic conception that everything has a double nature
and existence. Do children form similar ideas? We can
see from the autobiography of George Sand how a clever
girl, reflecting on the impressive experience of the echo, excogitates
such a theory of her double existence; and we
know, too, that the boy Hartley Coleridge distinguished
among the ‘Hartleys’ a picture Hartley and a shadow
Hartley. C.’s biography suggests that being photographed
may appear to a child as a transmutation, if not a doubling,
of the self. But much more needs to be known about these
matters.</p>

<p class='c001'>The prominence of the bodily pictorial element in the
child’s first idea of self is seen in the tendency to restrict
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>personal identity within the limits of an unchanged bodily
appearance. The child of six, with his shock of curls,
refuses to believe that he is the same as the hairless baby
whose photograph the mother shows him. How different,
how new, a being a child feels on a Sunday morning after
the extra weekly cleansing and brushing and draping. The
bodily appearance is a very big slice of the content of most
people’s self-consciousness, and to the child it is almost
everything.</p>

<p class='c001'>But in time the conscious self, which thinks and suffers
and wills, comes to be dimly discerned. I believe that a
real advance towards this true self-consciousness is marked
by the appropriation and use of the difficult forms of
language, ‘I,’ ‘me,’ ‘mine’. This will be dealt with in
another essay.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sometimes the apprehension of the existence of a hidden
self distinct from the body comes as a sudden revelation, as
to little George Sand. Such a swift awakening of self-consciousness
is apt to be an epoch-making and memorable
moment in the history of the child.</p>

<p class='c001'>A father sends me the following notes on the development
of self-consciousness: “My girl, three years old,
makes an extraordinary distinction between her body and
herself. Lying in bed she shut her eyes and said: ‘Mother,
you can’t see me now’. The mother replied: ‘Oh, you
little goose, I can see you but you can’t see me’. To
which she rejoined: ‘Oh, yes, I know you can see <em>my body</em>,
mother, but you can’t see <em>me</em>’.” The same child about the
same time was concerned about the reality of her own
existence. One day playing with her dolls she asked her
mother: “Mother, am <em>I</em> real, or only a pretend like my
dolls?” Here again, it is plain, the emphasis was laid on
something non-corporeal, something that animated the
body, and not a mere bit of mechanism put inside it. Two
years later she showed a still finer intellectual differentiation
of the visible and the invisible self. Her brother
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>happened to ask her what they fed the bears on at the
Zoo. She answered impulsively: “Dead babies and that
sort of thing”. On this the mother interposed: “Why, F.,
you don’t think mothers would give their dead babies to the
animals?” To this she replied: “Why not, mother? It’s
only their bodies. I shouldn’t mind your giving mine.”
This contempt for the body is an excellent example of the
way in which a child when he gets hold of an idea pushes
it to its logical extreme. This little girl by-the-bye was
she who, about the same age, took compassion on the
poor autumn leaves dying on the ground, so that we may
suppose her mind to have been brooding at this time on
the conscious side of existence.</p>

<p class='c001'>The mystery of self-existence has probably been a
puzzle to many a thoughtful child. A lady, a well-known
writer of fiction, sends me the following recollection of her
early thought on this subject: “The existence of other
people seemed natural: it was the ‘I’ that seemed so
strange to me. That I should be able to perceive, to
think, to cause other people to act, seemed to me quite to
be expected, but the power of feeling and acting and
moving about myself, under the guidance of some internal
self, amazed me continually.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It is of course hard to say how exactly the child thinks
about this inner self. It seems to me probable that, allowing
for the great differences in reflective power, children in
general, like uncivilised races, tend to materialise it, thinking
of it dimly as a film-like shadow-like likeness of the
visible self. The problem is complicated for the child’s
consciousness by religious instruction with its idea of an
undying soul.</p>

<p class='c001'>As may be seen in the recollections just quoted, this
early thought about self is greatly occupied with its action
on the body. Among the many things that puzzled the
much-questioning little lad already frequently quoted was
this: “How do my thoughts come down from my brain to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>my mouth: and how does my spirit make my legs walk?”
C.’s sister when four years and ten months old wanted to
know how it is we can move our arm and keep it still when
we want to, while the curtain can’t move except somebody
moves it. The first attempts to solve the puzzle are of
course materialistic, as may be seen in our little questioner’s
delightful notion of thoughts travelling through the body.
This form of materialism, however, I find surviving in
grown-ups and even in students of psychology, who are
rather fond of talking about sensations travelling up the
nerves to the brain.</p>

<p class='c001'>Very curious are the directions of the first thought
about the past self. The idea of personal identity, so dear
to philosophers, does not appear to be fully reached at first.
On the contrary, as we shall see in the case of C., the past
self is divorced from the present under the image of the
opposite sex in the odd expression: “when I was a little
girl”. This probably illustrates the importance of the
bodily appearance as a factor in the self, for C. had, I believe,
been photographed when in the petticoat stage, and no
doubt looked back on this person in skirts as a girl. This is
borne out by the fact that another little boy when about
three and a half years old asked his mother: “Was I a girl
when I was small?” and that the little questioner whom I
have called our zoologist was also accustomed to say: “When
I was a ’ickle dirl (girl)”. But discarded petticoats do not
explain all the child’s ideas about his past self. This same
little zoologist would also say, “When I was a big man,” to
describe the state of things long, long ago. What does
this mean? In discussing the quaint idea of senile
shrinkage I have suggested that a child may think of
human existence as a series of transformations from littleness
to bigness, and the reverse, and here we have lighted
on another apparent evidence of it. For though we are
apt to call children ‘old men’ we do not suggest to them
that they are or have been big men.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>The difficulty to the child of conceiving of his remote
past, is surpassed by that of trying to understand the state
of things before he was born. The true mystery of birth
for the child, the mystery which fascinates and holds his
mind, is that of his beginning to be. This is illustrated
in C.’s question: “Where was I a hundred years ago?
Where was I before I was born?” It remains a mystery
for all of us, only that after a time we are wont to put it
aside. The child, on the other hand, is stung, so to say,
by the puzzle, his whole mind being roused to passionate
questioning.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is curious to note the differences in the attitude of
children’s minds towards the mystery. The small person
accustomed to petting, to be made the centre of others’
thought and action, may be struck with the blank in the
common home life before his arrival. A lady was talking
to her little girl H., aged three years, about something she
had done when she was a child. H. then wanted to know
what she was doing then, and was told by her mother:
“Oh, you were not here at all”. She seemed quite
amazed at this, and said: “And what did you do without
H.? Did you cry all day for her?” On being informed
that this was not the case, she seemed quite unable to
realise how her mother could have existed without her.
There is something of the charming egoism of the
child here, but there is more: there is the vague expression
of the unifying integrating work of love. Lovers, one is
told, are wont to think in the same way about the past
before they met, and became all in all to one another.
For this little girl with her strong sense of human attachment,
the idea of a real life without that which gave it
warmth and gladness was a contradiction.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sometimes again, in the more metaphysical sort of
child, the puzzle relates to the past existence of the outer
world. We have all been perplexed by the thought of
the earth and sky, and other folk existing before we were,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>and going on to exist after we cease to be; though here
again, save in the case of the philosopher perhaps, we get
used to the puzzle. Children may be deeply impressed
with this apparent contradiction. Jean Ingelow in her
interesting reminiscences thus writes of her puzzlings on
this head: "I went through a world of cogitation as to
whether it was really true that anything had been and
lived before I was there to see it.... I could think there
might have been some day when I was very little—as
small as the most tiny pebble on the road—but not to have
been at all was so very hard to believe." A little boy of
five who was rather given to saying ‘clever’ things, was
one day asked by a visitor, who thought to rebuke what
she took to be his conceit: “Why, M., however did the
world go round before you came into it?” M. at once
replied: “Why, it <em>didn’t</em> go round. It only began five years
ago.” Was this, as perhaps nine persons out of ten would
say, merely a bit of dialectic smartness, the evasion of an
awkward question by denying the assumed fact? I am
disposed to think that there was more, that the virtuous
intention of the visitor had chanced to discover a hidden
child-thought; for the child is naturally a Berkeleyan, in
so far at least that for him the reality of things is reality
for his own sense-perceptions. A world existent before he
was on the spot to see it, seems to the child’s intelligence
a contradiction.</p>

<p class='c001'>A child will sometimes use theological ideas as an
escape from this puzzle. The myth of babies being
brought down from heaven is particularly helpful. The
quick young intelligence sees in this pretty idea a way of
prolonging existence backwards. The same little boy
that was so concerned to know what his mother had
done without him, happened one day to be passing a
street pump with his mother, when he stopped and
observed with perfect gravity: “There are no pumps
in heaven where I came from”. He had evidently thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>out the legend of the God-sent baby to its logical consequences.</p>

<p class='c001'>Children appear to have very vague ideas about time.
Their minds cannot at first of course rise to the abstraction,
time, or duration, or to its measured portions, as a day.
They talk about the days as if they were things. Thus
to-day, yesterday, and to-morrow, which, as we may see
in C.’s way of talking about time, are used very vaguely
for present, past and future, are spoken of as things which
move. A girl of four asked: ‘Where is yesterday gone to?’
and ‘Where will to-morrow come from?’ The boy C.
as well as other children, as we saw, asked where all the
days go to. Such expressions may of course be figurative,
a child having no other way of describing the sequence
yesterday and to-day, to-day and to-morrow; yet I am
disposed to think that these are examples of the child’s
‘concretism,’ his reduction of our abstractions to living
realities.<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c011'><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It is equally noticeable that children have no adequate
mental representations of our time-measurements. As in
the case of space, so in that of time their standard is not
ours: an hour, say the first morning at school, may seem
an eternity to a child’s consciousness. The days, the
months, the years seem to fly faster and faster as we get
older. On the other hand, as in the case of space-judgments,
too, the child through his inability to represent
time on a large scale is apt to bring the past too near the
present. Mothers and young teachers would be surprised
if they knew how children interpreted their first historical
instruction introduced by the common phrase, ‘Many years
ago,’ or similar expression. A child of six years when
crossing the Red Sea asked to be shown Pharaoh and his
hosts. This looks like the effect of a vivid imagination of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>the scene, which even in grown people may beget an
expectation of seeing it here and now. The following
anecdote of a boy of five and a half years sent me by his
aunt more clearly illustrates a child’s idea of the historical
past. “H. was beginning to have English history read to
him and had got past the ‘Romans’ as he said. One day
he noticed a locket on my watch-chain, and desired that it
should be opened. It contained the hair of two babies
both dead long before. He asked about them. I told
him they died before I was born. ‘Did father know
them?’ he asked. ‘No, they died before <em>he</em> was born.’
‘Then who knew them and when did they live?’ he asked,
and as I hesitated for a moment, seeking how to make the
matter plain, ‘Was it in the time of the Romans?’ he
gravely asked.” The odd-looking historical perspective
here was quite natural. He had to localise the babies’
existence somewhere, and he could only do it conjecturally
by reference to the one far-off time of which he had heard,
and which presumably covered all that was before the
life-time of himself and of those about him.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><i>Theological Ideas.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>We may now pass to another group of children’s ideas,
a group already alluded to, those which have to do with
the invisible world, with death and what follows this—God
and heaven. Here we find an odd patchwork of thought,
the patchwork-look being due to the heterogeneous sources
of the child’s information, his own observations of the
visible world on the one hand, and the ideas supplied him
by what is called religious instruction on the other. The
characteristic activity of the child-mind, so far as we can
disengage it, is seen in the attempt to co-ordinate the disparate
and seemingly contradictory ideas into something
like a coherent system.</p>

<p class='c001'>Like the beginning of life, its termination, death, is one
of the recurring puzzles of childhood. This might be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>illustrated from almost any autobiographical reminiscences
of childhood. Here indeed the mystery, as may be seen
in C.’s case, is made the more impressive and recurrent to
consciousness by the element of dread. A little girl of
three and a half years asked her mother to put a great
stone on her head, because she did not want to die. She
was asked how a stone would prevent it, and answered with
perfect childish logic: “Because I shall not grow tall if you
put a great stone on my head; and people who grow tall
get old and then die”.</p>

<p class='c001'>Death seems to be thought of by the unsophisticated
child as the body reduced to a motionless state, devoid of
breath and unable any longer to feel or think. This is
the idea suggested by the sight of dead animals, which but
few children, however closely shielded, can escape.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first way of envisaging death seems to be as a
temporary state like sleep, which it so closely resembles.
A little boy of two and a half years, on hearing from his
mother of the death of a lady friend, at once asked: “Will
Mrs. P. still be dead when we go back to London?”</p>

<p class='c001'>The knowledge of burial gives a new and terrible turn
to his idea of death. He now begins to speculate much
about the grave. The instinctive tendency to carry over
the idea of life and sentience to the buried body is
illustrated in C.’s fear lest the earth should be put over his
eyes. The following observation from the Worcester Collection
illustrates the same tendency. “A few days ago
H. (aged four years four months) came to me and said:
‘Did you know they’d taken Deacon W. to Grafton?’ I.
‘Yes.’ H. ‘Well, I s’pose it’s the best thing. His folks
(meaning his children) are buried there, and they wouldn’t
know he was dead if he was buried here.’” This reversion
to savage notions of the dead in speaking of a Christian
deacon has a certain grim humour. All thoughts of
heaven were here forgotten in the absorbing interest in
the fate of the body.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>Do children when left to themselves work out a theory
of another life, that of the soul away from the dead deserted
body? It is of course difficult to say, all children
receiving some instruction at least of a religious character
respecting the future. One of the clearest approaches to
spontaneous child-thought that I have met with here is
supplied by the account of the Boston children. "Many
children (writes Professor Stanley Hall) locate all that is
good and imperfectly known in the country, and nearly a
dozen volunteered the statement that good people when
they die go to the country—even here from Boston." The
reference to good people shows that the children are here
trying to give concrete definiteness to something that has
been said by another. These children had not, one suspects,
received much systematic religious instruction. They
had perhaps gathered in a casual way the information
that good people when they die are to go to a nice place.
Children pick up much from the talk of their better-instructed
companions which they only half understand. In
any case it is interesting to note that they placed their
heaven in the country, the unknown beautiful region, where
all sorts of luxuries grow. One is reminded of the idea of
the happy hunting grounds to which the American Indian
consigns his dead chief. It would have been interesting
to examine these Boston children as to how they combined
this belief in going to the country with the burial of the
body in the city.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the case of children who pick up something of the
orthodox religious creed the idea of going to heaven has
somehow to be grasped and put side by side with that of
burial. How the child-mind behaves here it is hard to
say. It is probable that there are many comfortable and
stupid children who are not troubled by any appearance of
contradiction. As we saw in the remark of the American
child about the deacon, the child-mind may oscillate between
the native idea that the man lives on in a sense
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>underground, and the alien idea that he has passed into
heaven. Yet undoubtedly the more thoughtful kind of
child does try to bring the two ideas into agreement. The
boy C. attempted to do this first of all by supposing that
the people who went to heaven (the good) were not buried
at all; and later by postponing the going to heaven, the
true entrance being that of the body by way of the tomb.
Other ways of getting a consistent view of things are
also hit upon. Thus a little girl of five years thought
that the <em>head</em> only passed to heaven. This was no doubt a
way of understanding the communication from others that
the ‘body’ is buried. This inference is borne out by
another story of a boy of four and a half who asked how
much of his legs would have to be cut off when he was
buried. The legs were not the ‘body’. But the idea of the
head passing to heaven meant more than this. It pretty
certainly involved a localisation of the soul in the crown of
the body, and it may possibly have been helped by pictures
of cherub heads. Sometimes this process of child-thought
reflects that of early human thought, as when a little boy
of six said that God took the breath to heaven (<i>cf.</i> the
ideas underlying <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>spiritus</i></span> and πνεῦμα).</p>

<p class='c001'>In what precise manner children imagine the entrance
into heaven to take place I do not feel certain. The legend
of being borne by angels through the air probably assists
here. As we have seen, children tend to think of people
when they die as shrinking back to baby-dimensions so as
to be carried in the angels’ arms.</p>

<p class='c001'>The idea of people going to heaven is, as we know,
pushed by the little brain to its logical consequences.
Animals when they die pass to another place also. A boy
three years and nine months asked whether birds, insects,
and so forth go to heaven where people go when they die.
Yet a materialistic tendency shows itself here, especially in
connexion with the observation that animals are eaten.
A little American boy in his fifth year was playing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>with a tadpole till it died. Immediately the other tadpoles
ate it up, and the child burst out crying. His elder
sister with the best of intentions tried to comfort him by
saying: ‘Don’t cry, William, he’s gone to a better place’.
To which rather ill-timed assurance he retorted sceptically:
‘Are his brothers and sisters’ stomachs a better place?’</p>

<p class='c001'>Coming now to ideas of supernatural beings, it is to be
noted that children do not wholly depend for their conceptions
of these on religious or other instruction. The
liveliness of their imagination and their impulses of dread
and trust push them on to a spontaneous creation of invisible
beings. In C.’s haunting belief in the wolf we see
a sort of survival of the tendency of the savage to people
the unseen world with monsters in the shape of demons.
Another little boy of rather more than two years who had
received no religious instruction acquired a similar haunting
dread of ‘cocky,’ the name he had given to the cocks
and hens when in the country. He localised this evil
thing in the bathroom of the house, and he attributed
pains in the stomach to the malign influence of ‘cocky’.<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c011'><sup>[55]</sup></a>
Fear created the gods according to Lucretius, and in this
invention of evil beings bent on injuring him the child of a
modern civilised community may reproduce the process by
which man’s thoughts were first troubled by the apprehension
of invisible and supernatural agents.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand we find that the childish impulse to
seek aid leads to a belief in a more benign sort of being.
C.’s staunch belief in his fairies who could do the most
wonderful things for him, and more especially his invention
of the rain-god (the “Rainer”), are a clear illustration of
the working of this impulse.</p>

<p class='c001'>Even here, of course, while we can detect the play of a
spontaneous impulse, we have to recognise the influence
of instruction. C.’s tutelary deities, the fairies, were no doubt
<em>suggested</em> by his fairy stories; even though, as in the myth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>of the Rainer, we see how his active little mind proceeded
to work out the hints given him into quite original shapes.
This original adaptation shows itself on a large scale where
something like systematic religious instruction is supplied.
An intelligent child of four or five will in the laboratory of
his mind turn the ideas of God and the devil to strange
account. It would be interesting, if we could only get it, to
have a collection of all the hideous eerie forms by which the
young imagination has endeavoured to interpret the notion
of the devil. His renderings of the idea of God appear
to show hardly less of picturesque diversity.<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c011'><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It is to be noted at the outset that for the child’s intelligence
the ideas introduced by religious instruction at once
graft themselves on to those of fairy-lore. Mr. Spencer
has somewhere ridiculed our university type of education
with its juxtaposition of classical polytheism and Hebrew
monotheism. One might, perhaps, with still greater reason,
satirise the mixing up of fairy-story and Bible-story in the
instruction of a child of five. Who can wonder that the little
brain should throw together all these wondrous invisible
forms, and picture God as an angry or amiable old giant,
the angels as fairies and so forth? In George Sand’s child-romance
of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Corambé</cite></span> we see how far this blending of the
ideas of the two domains of the invisible world can be
carried.</p>

<p class='c001'>For the rest, the child in his almost pathetic effort to
catch the meaning of this religious instruction proceeds in
his characteristic matter-of-fact way by reducing the abstruse
symbols to terms of familiar every-day experience. He has
to understand and he can only understand by assimilating to
homely terrestrial facts. Hence the undisguised materialism
of the child’s theology. According to Stanley Hall’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>collection of observations, God was imaged by one child as a
man preternaturally big—a big blue man; by another as a
huge being with limbs spread all over the sky; by another
as so immensely tall that he could stand with one foot on
the ground, and touch the clouds,—strong like the giant, his
prototype. He is commonly, in conformity with what is told,
supposed to dwell in heaven, that is just the other side of
the blue and white floor, the sky. He is so near the clouds
that according to one small boy (our little friend the
zoologist) these are a sort of pleasaunce, composed of hills
and trees, which he has made to saunter in. But some
children are inventive even in respect of God’s whereabouts.
He has been regarded as inhabiting one of the stars. One
of Mr. Kratz’s children localised him ‘up in the moon,’ an
idea which probably owes something to observation of the
man in the moon. We note, too, a tendency to approximate
heaven and earth, possibly in order to account for
God’s frequent presence and activity here. Thus one of
Mr. Kratz’s children said that God was “up on the hill,”
and one little girl of five was in the habit of climbing
an old apple tree to visit him and tell him what she wanted.</p>

<p class='c001'>Differences of feeling, as well as differences in the
mode of instruction and in intelligence, seem to reflect themselves
in these ideas of the divine dwelling-place. As we
have seen, the childish intelligence is apt to envisage God
as a sort of grand lord with a house or mansion. Two
different tendencies show themselves in the thought about
this dwelling-place. On the one hand the feeling of childish
respect, which led a German girl of seven to address him
in the polite form, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">‘Ich bitte Sie,’</span> leads to a beautifying of
his house. According to some of the Bostonian children
he has birds, children, and Santa Claus living with him.
Others think of him as having a big park or pleasaunce
with trees, flowers, as well as birds. The children are
perhaps our dead people who in time will be sent back to
earth. Whether the birds, that I find come in again and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>again in the ideas of heaven, are dead birds, I am not sure.
While however there is this half-poetical adorning of God’s
palace, we see also a tendency to humanise it, to make it
like our familiar houses. This is quaintly illustrated in the
following prayer of a girl of seven whose grandfather had
just died: “Please, God, grandpapa has gone to you.
Please take great care of him. Please always mind and
shut the door, because he can’t stand the draughts.” We see
the same leaning to homely conceptions in the question of
a little girl of four: ‘Isn’t there a Mrs. God?’</p>

<p class='c001'>While thus relegated to the sublime regions of the sky
God is supposed to be doing things, and of course doing
them for us, sending down rain and so forth. What seems
to impress children most, especially boys, in the traditional
account of God is his power of making things. He is
emphatically the artificer, the demiurgos, who not only has
made the world, the stars, etc., but is still kept actively
employed by human needs. According to the Boston
children he fabricates all sorts of things from babies to
money, and the angels work for him. The boy has a great
admiration for the maker, and our small zoologist when
three years and ten months old, on seeing a group of working
men returning from their work, asked his astonished
mother: “Mamma, is these gods?” “God!” retorted his
mother, “why?” “Because,” he went on, “they makes
houses, and churches, mamma, same as God makes moons,
and people, and ’ickle dogs.” Another child watching a
man repairing the telegraph wires that rested on a high
pole at the top of a lofty house, asked if he was God. In
this way the child is apt to think of God descending to
earth in order to make things. Indeed, in their prayers,
children are wont to summon God as a sort of good genius
to do something difficult for them. A boy of four and a
half years was one day in the kitchen with his mother, and
would keep taking up the knives and using them. At last
his mother said: “L., you will cut your fingers, and if you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>do they won’t grow again”. He thought for a minute and
then said with a tone of deep conviction: “But God would
make them grow. He made <em>me</em>, so he could mend my
fingers, and if I were to cut the ends off I should say, ‘God,
God, come to your work,’ and he would say, ‘All right’.”<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c011'><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>While this way of recognising God as the busy artificer
is common, it is not universal. The child’s deity, like the
man’s (as Feuerbach showed), is a projection of himself,
and as there are lazy children, so there is a child’s God
who is a luxurious person sitting in a lovely arm-chair all
day, and at most putting out from heaven the moon and
stars at night.</p>

<p class='c001'>This admiration of God’s creative power is naturally
accompanied by that of his skill. A little boy once
said to his mother he would like to go to heaven to see
Jesus. Asked why, he replied: “Oh! he’s a great conjurer”.
The child had shortly before seen some human conjuring
and used this experience in a thoroughly childish fashion
by envisaging in a new light the New Testament miracle-worker.</p>

<p class='c001'>The idea of God’s omniscience seems to come naturally
to children. They are in the way of looking up to older
folks as possessing boundless information. C.’s belief in
the all-knowingness of the preacher, and his sister’s belief
in the all-knowingness of the policeman, show how readily
the child-mind falls in with the notion.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand I have heard of the dogma of God’s
infinite knowledge provoking a sceptical attitude in the
child-mind. This seems to be suggested in a rather rude
remark of a boy of four, bored by the long Sunday discourse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>of his mother: “Mother, does God know when you
are going to stop?” Our astute little zoologist, when five
years and seven months old, in a talk with his mother, impiously
sought to tone down the doctrine of omniscience in
this way: “I know a ’ickle more than Kitty, and you know
a ’ickle more than me; and God knows a ’ickle more than
you, I s’pose; then he can’t know so very much after all”.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another of the divine attributes does undoubtedly shock
the childish intelligence: I mean God’s omnipresence. It
seems, indeed, amazing that the so-called instructor of
the child should talk to him almost in the same breath
about God’s inhabiting heaven, and about his being everywhere
present. Here, I think, we see most plainly the
superiority of the child’s mind to the adult’s, in that it does
not let contradictory ideas lie peacefully side by side, but
makes them face one another. To the child, as we have
seen, God lives in the sky, though he is quite capable of
coming down to earth when he wishes or when he is politely
asked to do so. Hence he rejects the idea of a diffused
ubiquitous existence. The idea which is apt to be introduced
early as a moral instrument, that God can always see
the child, is especially resented by that small, sensitive,
proud creature, to whom the ever-following eyes of the
portrait on the wall seem a persecution. Miss Shinn, a
careful American observer of children, has written strongly,
yet not too strongly, on the repugnance of the child-mind
to this idea of an ever-spying eye.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c011'><sup>[58]</sup></a> My observations fully
confirm her conclusions here. Miss Shinn speaks of a little
girl, who, on learning that she was under this constant
surveillance, declared that she “would <em>not</em> be so tagged”.
A little English boy of three, on being informed by his
older sister that God can see and watch us while we cannot
see him, thought awhile, and then in an apologetic tone
said: “I’m very sorry, dear, I can’t (b)elieve you”. What
the sister, aged fifteen, thought of this is not recorded. An
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>American boy of five, learning that God was in the room
and could see even if the shutters were closed, said: “I know,
it’s jugglery”.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the idea is accepted odd devices are excogitated
for the purpose of making it intelligible. Thus one child
thought of God as a very small person who could easily
pass through the keyhole. The idea of God’s huge framework
illustrated above is probably the result of an attempt
to figure the conception of omnipresence. Curious conclusions
too are sometimes drawn from the supposition. Thus a little
girl of three years and nine months one day said to her
mother in the abrupt childish manner: “Mr. C. (a gentleman
she had known who had just died) is in this room”.
Her mother, naturally a good deal startled, answered: “Oh,
no!” Whereupon the child resumed: “Yes, he is. You
told me he is with God, and you told me God was everywhere,
so as Mr. C. is with God he must be in this room.”
With such trenchant logic does the child’s intelligence cut
through the tangle of incongruous ideas which we try to pass
off as methodical instruction.</p>

<p class='c001'>It might easily be supposed that the child’s readiness to
pray to God is inconsistent with what has just been said.
Yet I think there is no real inconsistency. Children’s idea
of prayer is, probably, that of sending a message to some
one at a distance. The epistolary manner noticeable in
many prayers seems to illustrate this.<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c011'><sup>[59]</sup></a> The mysterious
whispering is, I suspect, supposed in some inscrutable
fashion known only to the child to transmit itself to the
divine ear.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of the child’s belief in God’s goodness it is needless to
say much. For these little worshippers he is emphatically
the friend in need who can help them out of their difficulties
in a hundred ways. Our small zoologist thanked God for
making “the sea, the holes with crabs in them, and the
trees, the fields, and the flowers,” and regretted that he did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>not follow up the making of the animals we eat by doing
the cooking also. As their prayers show he is ever ready
to make nice presents, from a fine day to a toy-gun, and
will do them any kindness if only they ask prettily. Happy
the reign of this untroubled optimism. For many children,
alas, it is all too short, the colour of their life making them
lose faith in all kindness, and think of God as cross and
even as cruel.</p>

<p class='c001'>One of the real difficulties of theology for the child’s
intelligence is the doctrine of God’s eternity. Puzzled at
first with the fact of his own beginning, he comes soon to
be troubled with the idea of God’s having had no beginning.
C. showed a common trend of childish thought in
asking what God was like in his younger days. The
question, “Who made God?” seems to be one to which
all inquiring young minds are led at a certain stage of
child-thought. The metaphysical impulse of the child to
follow back the chain of events <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ad infinitum</i></span> finds the ever-existent
unchanging God very much in the way. He
wants to get behind this “always was” of God’s existence,
just as at an earlier stage of his development he wanted
to get behind the barrier of the blue hills. This is quaintly
illustrated in the reasoning of a child observed by M.
Egger. Having learnt from his mother that before the
world there was only God the Creator, he asked: “And
before God?” The mother having replied, “Nothing,”
he at once interpreted her answer by saying: “No; there
must have been the place (<i>i.e.</i>, the empty space) where
God is”. So determined is the little mind to get back to
the ‘before,’ and to find something, if only a prepared
place.</p>

<p class='c001'>Other mysteries of which the child comes to hear find
their characteristic solution in the busy little brain. A
friend tells me that when a child he was much puzzled by
the doctrine of the Trinity. He happened to be an only
child, and so he was led to put a meaning into it by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>assimilating it to the family group, in which the Holy Ghost
became the mother.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have tried to show that children seek to bring
meaning, and a consistent meaning, into the jumble of
communications about the unseen world to which they
are apt to be treated. I agree with Miss Shinn that
children about three and four are not disposed to theologise,
and are for the most part simply confused by the
accounts of God which they receive. Many of the less
bright of these small minds may remain untroubled by the
incongruities lurking in the mixture of ideas, half mythological
or poetical, half theological, which is thus introduced.
Such children are no worse than many adults, who
have a wonderful power of entertaining contradictory ideas
by keeping them safely apart in separate chambers of their
brain. The intelligent thoughtful child on the other hand
tries at least to reconcile and to combine in an intelligible
whole. His mind has not, like that of so many adults,
become habituated to the water-tight compartment arrangement,
in which there is no possibility of a leakage of ideas
from one group into another. Hence his puzzlings, his
questionings, his brave attempts to reduce the chaos to
order. I think it is about time to ask whether parents are
doing wisely in thus adding to the perplexing problems
of early days.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>V. <br /> THE LITTLE LINGUIST.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c017'><i>Prelinguistic Babblings.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>No part of the life of a child appeals to us more powerfully
perhaps than the first use of our language. The small
person’s first efforts in linguistics win us by a certain
graciousness, by the friendly impulse they disclose to get
mentally near us, to enter into the full fruition of human
intercourse. The difficulties, too, which we manage to lay
upon the young learner of our tongue, and the way in
which he grapples with these, lend a peculiar interest, half
pathetic, half humorous, to this field of infantile activity.
To the scientific observer of infancy, moreover, the noting
of the stages in the acquisition of speech is of the first
importance. Language is sound moulded into definite
forms and so made vehicular of ideas; and we may best
watch the unfoldings of childish thought by attending to
the way in which the word-sculptor takes the plastic sound-material
and works it into its picturesque variety of shapes.</p>

<p class='c001'>A special biological and anthropological interest attaches
to the child’s first essays in the use of words. Language
is that which most obviously marks off human from animal
intelligence. One of the most interesting problems in the
science of man’s origin and early development is how he
first acquired the power of using language-signs. If we
proceed on the biological principle that the development
of the individual represents in its main stages that of the
race, we may expect to find through the study of children’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>use of language hints as to how our race came by the invaluable
endowment. How far it is reasonable to expect
from a study of nursery linguistics a complete explanation
of the process by which man became speechful, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>homo
articulans</i></span>, will appear later on. But an examination of
these linguistics ought surely to be of some suggestive
value here.</p>

<p class='c001'>While there is this peculiar scientific interest in the first
manifestations of the speech-faculty in the child, they
are of a kind to lend themselves particularly well to a
methodic and exact observation. Articulate sounds are
sensible objects having well-defined characters which may be
accurately noted and described where the requisite fineness
of ear and quickness of perception are present. The difficulties
are no doubt great here: but they are precisely the
difficulties to sharpen the appetite of the true naturalist.
Hence we need not wonder that early articulation fills a
large place in the naturalist’s observation of infant life.
Preyer, for example, devotes one of the three sections of
his well-known monograph to this subject, and gives us a
careful and elaborate account of the progress of articulation
and of speech up to the end of the period dealt with (first
three years).</p>

<p class='c001'>Since these studies are especially concerned with the
characteristics of the child after language has been acquired
I shall not enter into the history of his rudimentary speech
at any great length. At the same time, since language is
a realm of activity in which the child betrays valuable
characteristics long after the third year, it deserves a special
study in this volume.</p>

<p class='c001'>As everybody knows, long before the child begins to
speak in the conventional sense he produces sounds. These
are at first cries and wanting in the definiteness of true
articulate sounds. Such cries are expressive, that is, utterances
of changing conditions of feeling, pain and pleasure,
and are also instinctive, springing out of certain congenital
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>nervous arrangements by which feeling acts upon the
muscular organs. This crying gradually differentiates itself
into a rich variety of expressions for hunger, cold, pain,
joy and so forth, of which it is safe to say that the majority
of nurses and mothers have at best but a very imperfect
knowledge.</p>

<p class='c001'>These cries disclose from the first a germ of articulate
sound, <i>viz.</i>, according to Preyer an approach to the vowel
sounds <em>u</em> (oo) and <em>ä</em> (Engl. <em>a</em> in ‘made’). This articulate
element becomes better defined and more varied in the
later cries, and serves in part to differentiate them one
from the other. Thus a difference of shade in the <em>a</em> (in
‘ah’), difficult to describe, has been observed to mark off
the cry of pleasure and of pain. Along with this articulate
sounds begin to appear in periods of happy contentment
under the form of infantile babbling or ‘la-la-ing’. Thus
the child will bring out a string of <em>a</em> and other vowel sounds.
In this baby-twittering the several vowel sounds of our
tongue become better distinguishable, and are strung together
in queer ways, as <em>ai-ā-au-â</em>. An attempt is made by Preyer
and others to give the precise order of the appearance of
the several vowel sounds. It is hardly to be expected that
observers would agree upon a matter so difficult to seize
and to describe; and this is what we find.<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c011'><sup>[60]</sup></a> After allowing,
however, for differences in the reading off, it seems
probable that there is a considerable diversity in the order
of development in the case of different children. This
applies still more to the appearance of the consonantal
sounds which long before the end of the sixth month
become combined with the vowels into syllabic sounds, as
<em>pa</em>, <em>ma</em>, <em>mam</em>, and so forth. Thus, though the labials <em>b</em>, <em>p</em>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span><em>m</em>, seem to come first in most cases, they may be accompanied,
if not preceded, by others, as the back open
sound <em>ch</em> (in Scotch ‘loch’), or (according to Preyer
and others) by the corresponding voiced sound, the hard
<em>g</em>. Similarly, sounds as <em>l</em> and <em>r</em>, which commonly
appear late, are said in some instances to occur quite
early.<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c011'><sup>[61]</sup></a> Attempts have been made to show that the
order of sounds here corresponds with that of advancing
physiological difficulty or amount of muscular effort involved.
Yet apart from the fact just touched on, that the order is not
uniform, it is very questionable whether the more common
order obeys any such simple physiological law.</p>

<p class='c001'>This primordial babbling is wonderfully rich and varied.
According to Preyer it contains most, if not all the sounds
which are afterwards used in speaking, and among these
some which cause much difficulty later on. It is thus a
wondrous contrivance of nature by which the child is made
to rehearse months beforehand for the difficult performances
of articulate speech. It is a preliminary trying of the
vocal instrument throughout the whole of its register.</p>

<p class='c001'>Though nurses are apt to fancy that in this pretty
babbling the infant is talking to itself there is no reason to
think that it amounts even to a rudiment of true speech.
To speak is to use a sound intentionally as the sign of an
idea. The babbling baby of five months cannot be supposed
to be connecting all these stray sounds with ideas, if
indeed it can be said to have as yet any definite ideas.
The only signification which this primitive articulation can
have is emotional. Undoubtedly, as we have seen, it grows
out of expressive cries. Even the happy bubblings over of
vowel sounds as the child lies on his back and ‘crows,’ may
be said to be expressive of his happiness like the movements
of arms and legs which accompany it. Yet it would be an
exaggeration to suppose that the elaborate phonation is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>merely expressive, that all the manifold and subtle changes
of sound are due to obscure variations of feeling.</p>

<p class='c001'>The true explanation seems to be that the appearance
of this infantile babbling, just like that of the movements of
the limbs which accompany it, is the result of changes in
the nervous system. As the centres of vocalisation get
developed, motor impulses begin to play on the muscles of
throat, larynx, and, later on, lips, tongue, etc., and in this
way a larger and larger variety of sound and sound-combination
is produced. Such phonation is commonly
described as impulsive. It is instinctive, that is to say,
unlearnt, and due to congenital nervous connexions; and
at best it can only be said to express in its totality a mood
or relatively permanent state of feeling.</p>

<p class='c001'>As this impulsive articulation develops it becomes complicated
by a distinctly intentional element. The child
hears the sounds he produces and falls in love with them.
From this moment he begins to go on babbling for the
pleasure it brings. We see the germ of such a pleasure-seeking
babbling in the protracted iterations of the same
sound. The first reduplications and serial iterations, <em>a-a</em>,
<em>ma-ma</em>, etc., may be due to physiological inertia, the mere
tendency to move along any track that happens to be struck,
the very same tendency which makes a prosy speaker go
on repeating himself. At the same time there is without
doubt in these infantile iterations a rudiment of self-imitation.
That is to say, the child having produced a
sound, as <em>na</em> or <em>am</em>, impulsively proceeds to repeat the <a id='corr137.28'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='perormance'>performance</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_137.28'><ins class='correction' title='perormance'>performance</ins></a></span>
in order to obtain a renewal of the sound-effect.
This renewed impulse may be supposed further to bring
with it a germ of the pleasure of iteration of sound, or
assonance. The addition of a simple rhythmic character
to the series of sounds is a further indication of its pleasure-seeking
character. Indeed we have in this infantile ‘la-la-ing’
more a rudiment of song and music than of articulate
speech. The rude vocal music of savages consists of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>similar rhythmic threading of meaningless sounds in which
as in this infantile song changes of feeling reflect themselves.
We may best describe this infantile babbling then as voice-play
and as rude spontaneous singing, the utterance of a
mood, indulged in for the sake of its own delight, and
serving by a happy arrangement of nature as a preliminary
practice in the production of articulate or linguistic sounds.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><i>Transition to Articulate Speech.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Let us now seek to understand how this undesigned
trying of the articulate instrument passes into true significant
articulation, how this speech-protoplasm develops into
the organism that we call language. And here the question
at once arises: Does the child tend to utilise the sounds
thus acquired as signs apart from the influence of education,
that is to say, of the articulate sounds produced by others
and impressed as signs upon his attention? The question
is not easy to answer owing to the early development of
the imitative impulse and to the constant and all-pervading
influence of education in the nursery. Yet I will offer
a tentative answer.</p>

<p class='c001'>That a child when he has reached a certain stage of intelligence
would be able to make use of signs quite apart
from example and education is what one might expect.
Any one who has noticed how a young cat, completely
isolated from the influence of example, will spontaneously
hit on the gesture of touching the arm of a person sitting
at a meal by way of asking to be fed, cannot be surprised
that children should prove themselves capable of inventing
signs. We know, too, that deaf-mutes will, self-prompted,
develop among themselves an elaborate system of gesture-signs,
and further express their feelings and desires by
sounds, which though not heard by themselves may be
understood by others and so serve as effective signs of
their needs and wishes. The normal child, too, in spite of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>the powerful influences which go to make him adopt as
signs the articulate sounds employed by others, shows a
germ of unprompted and original sign-making. The
earliest of such unlearnt signs are simple gesture-movements,
such as stretching out the arms when the child
desires to be taken by the nurse.<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c011'><sup>[62]</sup></a> Nobody has suggested
that these are learnt by imitation. The same is true of
other familiar gesture-movements, which appear towards the
end of the first year or later, as pulling your dress just as a
dog does, when the child wants you to go with him, touching
the chair when he wants you to sit down, or (as Darwin’s
child did when just over a year) taking a bit of paper and
pointing to the fire by way of signifying his wish to see the
paper burnt. The gesture of pointing, though no doubt
commonly aided by example, is probably capable of being
reached instinctively as an outgrowth from the grasping
movement.</p>

<p class='c001'>These gesture-signs, I find, play a larger part in the
case of children who are backward in talking, and so are
nearer the condition of the deaf-mute. Thus a lady in
sending me notes on her three children remarks that the
one who was particularly backward in his speech made a
free use of gesture-signs. When sixteen months old he
had certain <em>general</em> signs of this sort, using a sniff as a sign
of flower, and a mimic kiss as a sign of living things, <i>i.e.</i>,
all sorts of animals.<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c011'><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Just as movements may thus be used instinctively, that
is, without aid from others’ example, both as expressing
simple feelings and desires, and also, as in the case just
mentioned, as indicating ideas, so spontaneously formed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>sounds may be used as signs. As pointed out above the
first self-prompted articulation is closely connected with
feeling, and we find that in the second half-year when the
preliminary practice has been gone through certain sounds
take on a distinctly expressive function. Thus one little
boy when eight months old habitually used the sound ‘ma-ma’
when miserable, and ‘da-da’ when pleased. Among
these instinctive expressive sounds one of the most important
is that indicative of hunger. I find again and again
that a special sound is marked off as a mode of expression
or sign of this craving. This fact will be referred to again
presently.</p>

<p class='c001'>True language-sounds significant of things grow out of
this spontaneous expressive articulation. Thus the demonstrative
sign <em>da</em> which accompanies the pointing, and which
seems to be frequently used with slight modifications by
German as well as by English children, is probably in its
inception merely an interjectional expression of the faint
shock of wonder produced by the appearance in the visual
field of a new object. But used as a concomitant of the
pointing gesture it takes on a demonstrative or indicative
function, announcing the presence or arrival of an object in
a particular locality or direction. A somewhat similar case
is that of ‘ata’ or ‘tata,’ a sign used to denote the departure
or disappearance of an object. These signs are, as
Preyer shows, spontaneous and not imitative (<i>e.g.</i>, of
‘there’ (da), ‘all gone’). This is confirmed by the fact
that they vary greatly. Thus Preyer’s boy used for
“there” ‘da,’ ‘nda,’ ‘nta,’ etc., and for “all gone” ‘atta,’
‘f-tu,’ ‘tuff,’ etc. Again, Tiedemann’s boy used the
sound ‘ah-ah,’ and one of Stanley Hall’s children
the sound ‘eh,’ when pointing to an object. We may
conclude then that there are spontaneous vocal reactions
expressive of the contrasting mental states answering to the
appearance or arrival and the disappearance or departure
of an impressive and interesting object, and that, further,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>these reactions when recognised by others tend to become
fixed as linguistic signs.<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c011'><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Just as in the case of the gesture-movements, sniffing,
kissing, so in that of expressive vocal sounds we may see
a tendency to take on the function of true signs of ideas.
One of the best illustrations of this is to be found in the
invention of a word-sound for things to eat. I have pointed
out that the state of hunger with its characteristic misery
becomes at an early stage marked off by a distinctive expressive
sign. At a later stage this or some other sound
comes to be used intelligently as a means of <em>asking</em> for food.
Darwin’s boy employed the sound <em>mum</em> in this way; another
English child used ‘numby,’ and yet another ‘nini’; a French
child observed by M. Taine made use of ‘ham’. The predominance
of the labial <em>m</em> shows the early formation of
these quasi-linguistic signs, and suggests that they were
developed out of the primary instinctive ‘<em>m</em>’ sound.<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c011'><sup>[65]</sup></a> Such
sounds, coming to be understood by the nurse, tend to
become fixed as modes of asking for food.</p>

<p class='c001'>It seems but a step from the demand ‘Give me food’ to
the pointing out or naming of things as food. And so good
an observer as Darwin says that his boy used the sound
‘mum’ not only for conveying the demand or command
‘Give me food,’ but also as a substantive ‘food’ of wide
application. He later went on to erect a rudimentary
classification on the basis of this substantive, calling sugar
‘shu-mum’ and even breaking up this subdivision by calling
liquorice “black shu-mum”.<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c011'><sup>[66]</sup></a> This however seems, so far as
I can ascertain, to be exceptional. In most vocabularies of
children of two or three no generic term for food is found,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>though names for particular kinds of food, <i>e.g.</i>, milk, bread,
are in use. This agrees with the general order of development
of thought-signs, the names of easily distinguished
species appearing in the case of the individual as in that
of the race before those of comprehensive and ‘abstract’
genera such as ‘food’. It is probable, therefore, that these
early signs for food are but imperfectly developed into true
thought-symbols or names. They retain much of their
primordial character as expressions of desire and possibly
of the volitional state answering to a command. This is
borne out by the fact that the child spoken of by Taine
used the sound ‘tem’ as a sort of general imperative for
‘give!’ ‘take!’ ‘look!’ etc.<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c011'><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Another early example of an emotional expression
passing into a germinal sign is that called forth at the sight
of moving creatures. This acts as a strong stimulus to the
baby brain, and vigorous muscular reactions, vocal and
other, are wont to appear. One little boy of twelve and
three-quarter months usually expressed his excitement by the
sound “Dō-boo-boo,” which was used regularly for about
ten days on the appearance of a dog, a horse, a bird, and
so forth. Here we have a protoplasmic condition of the
lingual organism which we call a name, a condition destined
never to pass into another and higher. Sometimes, however,
these explosives at the sight of animal life grow into
comparatively fixed signs of recognition.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this spontaneous invention of quasi-linguistic sounds
imitation plays a considerable part. It is evident, indeed,
that gestures are largely imitative. Thus the sniff and the
mimic kiss referred to just now are plainly imitations of
movements. The pointing gesture, too, may be said to be
a kind of imitation of the reaching and appropriating movement
of the arm. The sound ‘dō-boo-boo’ used on seeing
an animal was probably imitative. According to Preyer
the sounds called forth by the sight of moving objects,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span><i>e.g.</i>, rolling balls and wheels, are imitative.<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c011'><sup>[68]</sup></a> Whether the
signs of hunger, ‘mum,’ ‘numby,’ are due to modifications of
the movements carried out in sucking, seems to be more
problematic.<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c011'><sup>[69]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In certain cases imitation is the one sufficient source of
the sound. In what are called onomatopoetic sounds the
child seeks to mimic some natural sound, and such imitation
is capable of becoming a fruitful source of original linguistic
invention. A boy between nine and ten months imitated
the sound of young roosters by drawing in his breath, and
this noise became for a time a kind of name for any
feathered creature, including small birds. More commonly
such onomatopoetic sounds come to be distinctive recognition-signs
of particular classes of animals, such as ‘oua-oua’
or ‘bow-wow’ for the dog, ‘moo-moo’ for the cow, ‘ouack-ouack’
or ‘kuack’ for the duck, and so forth.</p>

<p class='c001'>It may, of course, be said that these mimic sounds are
in part learnt from the traditional vocabulary of the nursery,
in which the nurse takes good care to instruct the child.
But it is to be remembered that the traditional nursery
language itself is largely an adoption of children’s own
sounds. There is, moreover, ample independent evidence
to show that children are zealous and indefatigable imitators
of the sounds they hear as of the movements they see.
Towards the end of the first six months and during the
second half-year a child is apt to imitate eagerly any sound
you choose to produce before him. In the case of Preyer’s
boy this impulse to repeat the sounds he heard developed
into a kind of echoing mania. The acquisition of others’
language plainly depends on the existence and the vigour
of this mimetic impulse. And this same impulse leads the
child beyond the servile adoption of our conventional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>sounds to the invention of new or onomatopoetic sounds.
Thus one little child discovered the pretty sound ‘tin-tin’
as a name for the bell. Another child, a girl, quite unprompted,
used a chirping sound for a bird, and a curious
clicking noise on seeing the picture of a horse (no doubt in
imitation of the sound of a horse’s hoofs); while a little boy
used a faint whistle to indicate a bird, and the sound ‘click-click’
to denote a horse. In some cases a grown-up person’s
imitation of a sound is imitated. Thus a child of about
two used the sound ‘afta’ as a name for drinking, and also
for drinking-vessel, “in imitation of the sound of sucking in
air which the nurse used to make when <em>pretending to drink</em>”.<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c011'><sup>[70]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In these two sources of original child-language, expression
of states of feeling, desire, etc., and imitation, we
have the two commonly assigned origins of human
language. Into the difficult question how man first came
to the use of language-sounds I do not propose to enter
here. Whatever view may be taken with respect to the
first beginnings of human speech, there seems little doubt
that both expressive cries and imitations of natural sounds
have had their place. To this extent, then, we may say
that there is a parallelism between the early evolution of
language in the case of the individual and in that of the
race. Not only so, it may be said that our study of these
tentatives of the child in language-formation tends to
confirm the conclusions of philology and anthropology that
the current of human speech did probably originate, in
main part at least, by way of these two tributaries.<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c011'><sup>[71]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>While vocal sounds which are clearly traceable to
emotional expressions or to imitations form the staple of
the normal child’s inventions they do not exhaust them.
Some of these early self-prompted linguistic sounds cannot
be readily explained. I find, for example, that children
are apt to invent names for their nurses and sometimes for
themselves which, so far as I can ascertain, bear no discoverable
resemblance to the sounds used by others. Thus
the same little girl that invented ‘numby’ for food and
‘afta’ for drinking called her nurse ‘Lee’ though no one
else called her by any other name than ‘nurse’. It is
difficult to suppose that the child was transforming the sound
‘nurse’ in this case. Preyer’s boy called his nurse, whom
others addressed as Marie, ‘Wolá,’ which Preyer explains
rather forcedly as deriving by inversion from the frequently
heard <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">‘Ja wohl!’</span> A lady friend informs me that
her little boy when thirteen months old called himself
‘Bla-a,’ though he was always addressed by others as
Jeffrey, and that he stuck to ‘Bla-a’ for six months.<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c011'><sup>[72]</sup></a> A
germ of imitation is doubtless recognisable here in the
preservation of the syllabic form or structure (that of monosyllable
or dissyllable). Yet the amount of transformation
is, to say the least, surprising in children, who show themselves
capable of fairly close imitation. Possibly a child’s
ear notes analogies of sound which escape our more sophisticated
organ. However this be, the fact of such origination
of names (other than those clearly onomatopoetic) is
noteworthy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lastly a reference may be made to the fact that children
have shown themselves capable of inventing the rudiments
of a simple kind of language. Professor Horatio Hale of
America has made a special study of these spontaneous
child-languages. One case is that of twin American boys
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>who when the talking age came employed not the English
sounds that they heard others speak but a language of their
own. Another, and in some ways more remarkable case,
is that of a little girl who at the age of two was backward
in speaking, only using the names ‘papa’ and ‘mamma,’
and who, nevertheless, at that age, and in the first instance
without any stimulus or aid from a companion, proceeded
to invent a vocabulary and even simple sentence-forms of
her own, which she subsequently prevailed on an elder
brother to use with her. The vocables struck out, though
suggesting some slight aural acquaintance with French—which,
however, was never spoken in her home—are apparently
quite arbitrary and not susceptible of explanation by
imitation.<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c011'><sup>[73]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>I think the facts here brought together testify to the
originality of the child in the field of linguistics. It may
be said that in none of these cases is the effect of education
wholly absent. A child, as we all know, is taught the
names of objects and actions long before he can articulate.
Thus Darwin’s boy knew the name of his nurse five months
before he invented the vocable ‘mum’. It is obvious
indeed that wherever children are subjected to normal
training their sign-making impulse is stimulated by the
example of others. At the same time the facts here given
show that the working of this impulse may, in a certain
number of children at least, strike out original lines of its
own independently of the direct action of example and
education. What is wanted now is to experiment carefully
with an intelligent child, encouraging him to make
signs by patient attention and ready understanding, but
at the same time carefully abstaining from giving the lead
or even taking up and adopting the first utterances so as to
bring in the influence of imitation. I think there is little
doubt that a child so situated might develop the rudiments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>of a vocal language. The experiment would be difficult to
carry out, as it would mean the depriving of the child for a
time of the advantages of education.<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c011'><sup>[74]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'><i>Beginnings of Linguistic Imitation.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>The learning of the mother-tongue is one of the most
instructive and, one may add, the most entertaining chapters
in the history of the child’s education. The brave efforts
to understand and follow, the characteristic and quaint
errors that often result, the frequent outbursts of originality
in bold attempts to enrich our vocabulary and our linguistic
forms—all this will repay the most serious study, while it
will provide ample amusement.</p>

<p class='c001'>As pointed out above the learning of the mother-tongue
is essentially a kind of imitation. The process
is roughly as follows. The child hears a particular sound
used by another, and gradually associates it with the
object, the occurrence, the situation, along with which it
again and again presents itself. When this stage is reached
he can understand the word-sound as used by another
though he cannot as yet use it. Later, by a considerable
interval, he learns to connect the particular sound with the
appropriate vocal action required for its production. As
soon as this connexion is formed his sign-making impulse
imitatively appropriates it by repeating it in circumstances
similar to those in which he has heard others employ it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The imitation of others’ articulate sounds begins, as
already remarked, very early and long before the sign-making
impulse appropriates them as true words. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>impulse to imitate others’ movements seems first to come
into play about the end of the fourth month; and traces
of imitative movements of the mouth in articulation are
said to have been observed in certain cases about this time.
But it is only in the second half-year that the imitation of
sounds becomes clearly marked. At first this imitation is
rather of tone, rise and fall of voice, and apportioning of
stress or accent than of articulate quality; but gradually
the imitation takes on a more definite and complete
character.<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c011'><sup>[75]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Towards the end of the year, in favourable cases, true
linguistic imitation commences. That is to say, word-sounds
gathered from others are used as such. Thus, a
boy of ten months would correctly name his mother,
‘Mamma,’ his aunt, ‘Addy’ (Aunty), and a person called
Maggie, ‘Azzie’.<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c011'><sup>[76]</sup></a> As already suggested, this imitative
reproduction of others’ words synchronises, roughly at least,
with the first onomatopoetic imitation of natural sounds.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><i>Transformations of our Words.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>As is well known the first tentatives in the use of the
common speech-forms are very rough. The child in reproducing
transforms, and these transformations are often
curious and sufficiently puzzling.</p>

<p class='c001'>The most obvious thing about these first infantile
renderings of the adult’s language is that they are a
simplification. This applies to all words alike. Monosyllables
if involving a complex mass of sound are usually
reduced, as when ‘dance’ is shortened to ‘da’. This
clearly illustrates the difficulty of certain sound-combinations,
a point to be touched on presently. More striking is
the habitual reduction of dissyllables and polysyllables.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>Here we note that the child concentrates his effort on the
reproduction of a part only of the syllabic series, which
part he may of course give but very imperfectly. The
shortening tends to go to the length of reducing to a
monosyllable. Thus ‘biscuit’ becomes ‘bik,’ ‘Constance’
‘tun,’ ‘candle’ ‘ka,’ ‘bread and butter’ ‘bup’ or ‘bŭ’.
Polysyllables, though occasionally cut down to monosyllables,
as when ‘hippopotamus’ became ‘pots,’ are more
frequently reduced to dissyllables, as when ‘periwinkle’
was shortened to ‘pinkle’. Handkerchief is a trying word
for the English child, and for obvious reasons has to be
learnt. It was reduced by the eldest child of a family to
‘hankish,’ by the two next to ‘hamfisch’ and by the last
two to ‘hanky’. The little girl M. also reduced the last
two syllables to ‘fish,’ making the sound ‘hanfish’.</p>

<p class='c001'>There seems to be no simple law governing these reductions
of verbal masses. The accentuated syllable, by
exciting most attention, is commonly the one reproduced,
as when ‘nasturtium’ became ‘turtium’.<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c011'><sup>[77]</sup></a> In the case of
long words the position of a syllable at the beginning
or at the end of the word seems to give an advantage
in this competition of sounds, the former by impressing
the sound as the first heard (compare the way in which
we note and remember the initial sound of a name),<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c011'><sup>[78]</sup></a> the
latter by impressing it as the last heard, and therefore best
retained. The unequal articulatory facility of the several
sound-combinations making up the word may also have an
influence on this unconscious selection. I think it not
unlikely, too, that germs of a kind of æsthetic preference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>for certain sounds as new, striking or fine, may co-operate
here.<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c011'><sup>[79]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Such simplification of words is from the first opposed,
and tends in time to be counteracted, by the growth of a
feeling for their general form as determined by the number
of syllables, as well as the distribution of stress and any
accompanying alterations of tone or pitch. The infant’s
first imitations of the sounds ‘good-bye,’ ‘all gone,’ and
so forth, by couples which preserve hardly anything of
the articulatory character, though they indicate the
syllabic form, position of stress, and rising and falling
inflection, illustrate the early development of this feeling.
Hence we find in general an attempt to reproduce the
number of syllables, and also to give the proper distribution
of stress. Thus ‘biscuit’ becomes ‘bítchic,’ ‘cellar’ ‘sítoo,’
‘umbrella’ ‘nobélla,’ ‘elephant’ ‘étteno,’ or (by a German
child) ‘ewebón,’ ‘kangaroo’ ‘kógglegoo,’ ‘hippopotamus’
‘ippenpótany,’ and so forth.<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c011'><sup>[80]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>As suggested above there goes from the first with the
cutting down of the syllabic series a considerable alteration
of the single constituent sounds. The vowel sounds are
rarely omitted; yet they may be greatly modified, and
these modifications occur regularly enough to suggest that
the child finds certain nuances of vowel sounds comparatively
hard to reproduce. Thus the short <em>ă</em> in hat, and the
long <em>ī</em> (ai), seem to be acquired only after considerable
practice.<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c011'><sup>[81]</sup></a> But it is among the consonants that most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>trouble arises. Many of these, as the sibilants or ‘hisses,’
<em>s</em>, <em>sh</em>, the various <em>l</em> and <em>r</em> sounds, the dentals, the “point-teeth-open”
<em>th</em> and <em>dh</em> (in ‘thin,’ ‘this’), the back or
guttural ‘stops,’ <i>i.e.</i>, <em>k</em> and hard <em>g</em>, and others as <em>j</em> or soft <em>g</em>
(as in ‘James,’ ‘gem’), appear, often at least, to cause
difficulty at the beginning of the speech period. With
these must be reckoned such combinations as <em>st</em>, <em>str</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>In many cases the difficult sounds are merely dropped.
Thus ‘poor’ may become ‘poo,’ ‘look’ ‘ook,’ ‘Schulter’
(German) <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">‘Ulter’</span>. In the case of awkward combinations
this dropping is apt to be confined to the difficult sound,
provided, that is to say, the other is manageable alone.
Thus ‘dance’ becomes ‘dan,’ <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">‘trocken’</span> (German) becomes
‘tokko’. More particularly <em>s</em> and <em>sh</em> are apt to be omitted
before other consonants. Thus ‘stair’ becomes ‘tair,’
‘sneeze’ ‘neeze,’ <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">‘schneiden’</span> (German) ‘neida,’ and so
forth.</p>

<p class='c001'>Along with such lame omissions we have the more
vigorous procedure of substitutions. In certain cases there
seems little if any kinship between the sounds or the
articulatory actions by which they are produced. At the
early stage more particularly almost any manageable sound
seems to do duty as substitute. The early-acquired
labials, including the labio-dental <em>f</em> come in as serviceable
‘hacks’ at this stage. What we call lisping is indeed
exemplified in this class of infantile substitutions. Children
have been observed to say ‘fank’ for ‘thank’ and
‘mouf’ for ‘mouth,’ ‘feepy’ for ‘sleepy,’ ‘poofie’ for ‘pussy,’
‘wiver’ for ‘river,’ ‘Bampe’ for <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">‘Lampe’</span> (German). The
dentals, too, <em>d</em> and <em>t</em>, are turned to all kinds of vicarious
service. Thus we find ‘ribbon’ rendered by ‘dib,’ ‘gum’
by ‘dam,’ <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">‘Greete’</span> (German) by ‘Deete,’ <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">‘Gummi’</span> (German)
by ‘Dummi,’ ‘cut’ by ‘tut,’ and <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">‘klopfen’</span> (German) by ‘topfen’.
Similarly ‘gee-gee’ (horse), which oddly enough was
first rendered by the child M. as ‘dee-gee,’ is altered to ‘dee-dee’.
I find too that new sounds are apt to be put to this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>miscellaneous use. Thus one child after learning the aspirate
(<em>h</em>) at two years not only brought it out with great
emphasis in its proper place but began to use it as a
substitute for other and unmanageable sounds. Thus he
would say, ‘hie down on hofa’ for ‘lie down on sofa’.
The aspirate is further used in place of <em>sh</em>, as when ‘shake’
was rendered by ‘hate,’ and of <em>st</em>, as when Preyer’s boy
called ‘Stern’ ‘Hern’. In other cases we see that the little
linguist is trying to get as near as possible to the sound,
and such approximations are an interesting sign of progress.
Thus in one case ‘chatterbox’ was rendered by
‘jabberwock,’ in another case ‘dress’ by ‘desh,’ in another
(Preyer’s boy), <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">‘Tisch’</span> (German) by ‘Tiss’.<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c011'><sup>[82]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Besides omissions and substitution of sounds, occasional
insertions are said to occur. According to one set of observations
<em>r</em> may be inserted after the broad <em>a</em>, as when
‘pocket’ was rendered by ‘barket’. A cockney is apt to
do the same, as when he talks of having a ‘barth’ (bath).
Yet this observation requires to be verified.</p>

<p class='c001'>These alterations of articulate sound by the child remind
one of the changes which the languages of communities
undergo. We know, indeed, that these changes are due to
imperfect imitation by succeeding generations of learners.<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c011'><sup>[83]</sup></a>
Hence we need not be surprised to find now and again
analogies between these nursery transformations and those
of words in the development of languages. In reproducing
the sounds which he hears a child often illustrates a law of
adult phonetic change. Thus changes within the same
class of sounds, as the frequent alteration of ‘this’ into
‘dis,’ clearly correspond with those modifications recognised
in Grimm’s Law. So, too, the common substitution of a
dental for a guttural has its parallel in the changes of racial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>language.<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c011'><sup>[84]</sup></a> Nobody again can note the transformation of
<em>n</em> into <em>m</em> before <em>f</em> in the form ‘hamfish’ for ‘handkerchief’
without thinking of the Greek change of συν into συμ before
β, and like changes. Philologists may probably find many
other parallels. One of them tells me that his little girl, on
rendering <em>sh</em> by the guttural <em>h</em>, reproduced a change in
Spanish pronunciation. M. Egger compares a child’s
rendering of ‘<em>tr</em>op’ (French) by ‘<em>cr</em>op’ with the transformation
of the Latin ‘<em>tr</em>emere’ into ‘<em>cr</em>aindre’.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have assumed here that children’s defective reproduction
of our verbal sounds is the result of inability to produce
certain sounds and not due to the want of a discrimination of
the sounds by the ear. This may seem strange in the light
of Preyer’s statement that the earlier impulsive babbling includes
most, if not all, of the sounds required later on for
articulation. This may turn out to be an exaggeration, yet
there is no doubt, I think, that certain sounds, including
some as the initial <em>l</em> which are common in the earlier
babbling stage, are not produced at the beginning of the
articulatory period. As the avoidance of these occurs in all
children alike it seems reasonable to infer that they involve
difficult muscular combinations in the articulatory organ.
At the same time it seems going too far to say, as Schultze
does, that the order of acquisition of sounds corresponds
with the degree of difficulty. The very variability of this
order in the case of different children shows that there is
no such simple correspondence as this.<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c011'><sup>[85]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The explanation of those early omissions and alterations
is probably a rather complex matter. To begin with, the
speech-organs of a child may lose special aptitudes by the
development of other and opposed aptitudes. A friend of
mine, a physiologist, tells me that his little boy who said
‘ma-ma’ (but not ‘da-da’) at ten months lost at the age of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>nineteen months the use of <em>m</em>, for which he regularly substituted
<em>b</em>. He suggests that the nasal sound <em>m</em>, though easy
for a child in the sucking stage and accustomed to close the
lips, may become difficult later on through the acquisition of
open sounds. It is worth considering whether this principle
does not apply to other inabilities. This, however, is a
question for the science of phonetics.</p>

<p class='c001'>We must remember, further, that it is one thing to
carry out an articulatory movement as a child of nine
months carries it out, ‘impulsively,’ through some congenitally
arranged mode of exciting the proper motor centre,
another thing to carry it out volitionally, <i>i.e.</i>, in order to
produce a desired result. This last means that the sound-effect
of the movement has been learned, that the image or
representation of it has been brought into definite connexion
with a particular impulse, <i>viz.</i>, that of carrying out the
required movement: and this is now known to depend on
the formation of some definite neural connexion between
the auditory and the motor regions of the speech-centre.
This process is clearly more complex than the first instinctive
utterance, and may be furthered or hindered by various
conditions. Thus a child’s own spontaneous babblings
may not have sufficed to impress a particular sound on the
memory; in which case his acquisition of it will be favoured
or otherwise by the frequency with which it is produced by
others in his hearing. It is probable that differences in the
range and accuracy of production of sounds by nurse and
mother tell from the first. The differences observable in
the order of acquisition of sounds among children may be
in part due to this, and not merely to differences in the
speech-organ. It is probable, too, that children’s attention
may be especially called to certain sounds or sound-groups,
either because of a preferential liking for the sounds themselves,
or because of a special need of them as useful names.
M.’s mother assures me that the child seemed to dislike
particular sounds as <em>j</em>, which she could and did occasionally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>pronounce, though she was given to altering them.<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c011'><sup>[86]</sup></a>
Another lady writes that her boy at the age of twenty-two
months surprised her by suddenly bringing out the combination
‘scissors’. He had just begun to use scissors in
cutting up paper, and so had acquired a practical interest
in this sound-mass.</p>

<p class='c001'>We may now pass to another of the commonly recognised
defects of early articulation, <i>viz.</i>, the transposition of sounds
or metathesis. Sometimes it is two contiguous sounds
which are transposed, as when ‘star’ is rendered by ‘tsar’
and ‘spoon’ by ‘psoon’. Here the motive of the change is
evidently to facilitate the combination. We have a parallel
to this in the use of ‘aks’ (ax) for ‘ask,’ a transposition
which was not long since common enough in the West of
England.<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c011'><sup>[87]</sup></a> In other transpositions sounds are shifted
further from their place. Preyer quotes a case in which
there was a dislocation of vowel sounds, <i>viz.</i>, in the transformation
of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">‘bite’</span> (German) into ‘beti’.<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c011'><sup>[88]</sup></a> Here there
seems to be no question of avoiding a difficult combination.
Other examples are the following: ‘hoogshur’ for ‘sugar’
(one of the first noticed at the age of two); ‘mungar’ for
‘grandmamma,’ ‘punga’ for ‘grandpapa,’ and ‘natis’ for
‘nasty’ (boy between eighteen and twenty-four months); and
‘boofitul’ for ‘beautiful’. Here again we have an analogy
to defective speech in adults. When a man is very tired
he is liable to precisely similar inversions of order. The
explanation seems to be that the right group of sounds may
present itself to the speaker’s consciousness without any
clear apprehension of their temporal order. Perhaps quasi-æsthetic
preferences play a part here too. The child M.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>seems to have preferred the sequence <cite>m-n</cite> to <cite>n-m</cite>, saying
‘jaymen’ for <a id='corr156.2'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='‘geranium'>‘geranium’</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_156.2'><ins class='correction' title='‘geranium'>‘geranium’</ins></a></span>, ‘burman’ for ‘laburnum’.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another interesting feature in this early articulation is
the impulse to double sounds, to get a kind of effect of
assonance or of rhyme by a repetition of sound or sound-group.
The first and simplest form of this is where a whole
sound-mass or syllable is iterated, as in the familiar ‘ba-ba,’
‘gee-gee’ ‘ni-ni’ (for nice). Some children frequently turn
monosyllables into reduplications, making book ‘boom-boom’
and so forth. It is, however, in attempting dissyllables
that the reduplication is most common. Thus
‘naughty’ becomes ‘na-na,’ ‘faster’ ‘fa-fa,’ ‘Julia’ ‘dum-dum,’
and so forth, where the repeated syllable displaces the
second original syllable and so serves to retain something
of the original word-form. In some cases the second and
unaccented syllable is selected for reduplication, as in the
instance quoted by Perez, ‘peau-peau’ for ‘chapeau’.
Such reduplications are sometimes aided by kinship of
sound, as when the little girl M. changed ‘purple’ into its
primitive form ‘purpur’.</p>

<p class='c001'>These early reduplications are clearly a continuation of
the repetitions observable in the earlier babbling, and grow
out of the same motive, the impulse to go on doing a thing,
and the pleasure of repetition and self-imitation. As is
well known, these reduplications have their parallel in many
of the names used by savage tribes.<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c011'><sup>[89]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In addition to these palpable reduplications of sound-masses
we have repetitions of single sounds, the repeated
sound being substituted for another and foreign one. This
answers to what is called in phonetics ‘assimilations’.<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c011'><sup>[90]</sup></a>
In the majority of cases the assimilation is ‘progressive,’
the change being carried out by a preceding on a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>succeeding sound. Examples are ‘Kikie’ for ‘Kitty,’
and ‘purpur’ for ‘purple’. This last transformation,
though it was made by the little daughter of a distinguished
philologist, was quite innocent of classical influence, and
was clearly motived by the childish love of reduplication
of sound. In many cases the substitution of an easy for a
difficult sound seems to be determined in part by assimilation,
as when ‘another’ was rendered by ‘annunner,’
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘gateau’</span> (French) by ‘ca-co’. The assimilation seems, too,
sometimes to work “regressively,” as when ‘thick’ becomes
‘kick,’ ‘Bonnie Dundee’ ‘Bun-dun,’ and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘tortue’</span>
(French) ‘tu-tu,’ in which two last reduplication is
secured approximately or completely by change of vowel.<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c011'><sup>[91]</sup></a>
There seem also to be cases of what may be called
partial assimilation, that is, a tendency to transform a
sound into one of the same class as the first. “If (writes
a mother of her boy) a word began with a labial he
generally concluded it with a labial, making ‘bird,’ for
example, ‘bom’.” But these cases are not, perhaps, perfectly
clear examples of assimilation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Along with the tendency to reduplicate syllabic masses,
we see a disposition to use habitually certain favourite
syllables as terminations, more particularly the pet ending
‘<em>ie</em>’. Thus ‘sugar’ becomes ‘sugie,’ ‘picture’ ‘pickie,’ and
so forth. One child was so much in love with this syllable
as to prefer it even to the common repetition of sound in
onomatopoetic imitation, naming the hen not ‘tuck-tuck’
as one might expect, but ‘tuckie’.</p>

<p class='c001'>What strikes one in these early modifications of our
verbal sounds by the child is the care for metrical qualities
and the comparative disregard for articulatory characteristics.
The number of syllabic sounds, the distribution of stress,
as well as the rise and fall of vocal pitch, are the first things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>to be attended to, and these are, on the whole, carefully
rendered when the constituent sounds are changed into
other and often very unlike ones, and the order of the
sounds is reversed. Again, the comparative fidelity in
rendering the vowel sounds illustrates the prominence of the
metrical or musical quality in childish speech. The love of
reduplication, of the effect of assonance and rhyme, illustrates
the same point. This may be seen in some of the more
playful sayings of the child M., as ‘Babba hiding, Ice
(Alice) spiding (spying)’.</p>

<p class='c001'>As I have dwelt at some length on the defective articulation
of children, I should like to say that their early performances,
so far from being a discredit to them, are very
much to their credit. I, at least, have often been struck
with the sudden bringing forth without any preparatory
audible trial of difficult combinations, and with a wonderful
degree of accuracy. A child can often articulate better
than he is wont to do. The little girl M., when one year
six months, being asked teasingly to say ‘mudder,’ said
with a laugh ‘mother,’ quite correctly—but only on
this one occasion. The precision which a child, even in
the second year, will often give to our vocables is quite
surprising, and reminds me of the admirable exactness
which, as I have observed, other strangers to our language,
and more especially perhaps Russians, introduce into their
articulation, putting our own loose treatment of our
language to the blush. This precision, acquired as it would
seem without any tentative practice, points, I suspect, to a
good deal of silent rehearsal, nascent groupings of muscular
actions which are not carried far enough to produce sound.</p>

<p class='c001'>The gradual development of the child’s articulatory
powers, as indicated partly by the precision of the sounds
formed, partly by their differentiation and multiplication,
is a matter of great interest. At the beginning, when he
is able to reproduce only a small portion of a vocable,
there is of course but little differentiation. Thus it has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>been remarked by more than one observer, that one and
the same sound (so far at least as our ears can judge) will
represent different lingual signs, ‘ba’ standing in the case
of one child for both ‘basket’ and ‘sheep’ (‘ba lamb’), and
‘bo’ for ‘box’ and ‘bottle’. Little by little the sound grows
differentiated into a more definite and perfect form, and
it is curious to note the process of gradual evolution by
which the first rude attempt at articulate form gets improved
and refined. Thus, writes a mother, “at eighteen
to twenty months ‘milk’ was ‘gink,’ at twenty-one months
it was ‘ming,’ and soon after two years it was a sound
between ‘mik’ and ‘milk’.” The same child in learning
to say ‘lion’ went through the stages ‘ŭn’ (one year eight
months), ‘ion’ (two years), and ‘lion’ (two years and eight
months). The little girl M., in learning the word ‘breakfast,’
advanced by the stages ‘bepper,’ ‘beffert,’ ‘beffust’.
In an example given by Preyer, ‘grosspapa’ (grandpapa)
began as ‘opapa,’ this passed into ‘gropapa,’ and this
again into ‘grosspapa’. In another case given by Schultze
the word <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">‘wasser’</span> (pronounced ‘vasser’) went through the
following stages: (1) ‘vavaff,’ (2) ‘fafaff,’ (3) ‘vaffaff,’ (4)
‘vasse,’ and (5) ‘vasser’. In this last we have an interesting
illustration of a struggle between the imitative impulse
to reproduce the exact sound and the impulse to
reduplicate or repeat the sound, this last being very
apparent in the introduction of the second <em>v</em> and the <em>ff</em> in
the first stage, and in the substitution of the <em>f</em>’s for <em>v</em>’s
under the influence of the dominant final sound in the
second stage. The student of the early stages of language
growth might, one imagines, find many suggestive
parallels in these developmental changes in children’s
articulation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The rapidity of articulatory progress might be measured
by a careful noting of the increase in the number of vocables
mastered from month to month. Although Preyer and
others have given lists of vocables used at particular ages,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>and parents have sent me lists, I have met with no methodical
record of the gradual extension of the articulate field.
It is obvious that any observations under this head, save in
the very early stages, can only be very rough. No observer
of a talkative child, however attentive, can make sure of all
the word-sounds used. It is to be noted, too, as we have
seen above, that a child will sometimes show that he can
master a sound and will even make a temporary use of it,
without retaining it as a part of the permanent linguistic
stock.<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c011'><sup>[92]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'><i>Logical Side of Children’s Language.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>It is now time to pass from the mechanical to the logical
side of this early child-language, to the meanings which the
small linguist gives to his articulate sounds and the ways in
which he modifies these meanings. The growth of a child’s
speech means a concurrent progress in the mastery of word-forms
and in the acquisition of ideas. In this each of the
two factors aids the other, the advance of ideas pushing the
child to new uses of sounds, and the growing facility in
word-formation reacting powerfully on the ideas, giving
them definiteness of outline and fixity of structure. I shall
not attempt here to give a complete account of the process,
but content myself with touching on one or two of its more
interesting aspects.</p>

<p class='c001'>A child acquires the proper use or application of a word
by associating the sound heard with the object, situation or
action in connexion with which others are observed to use
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>it. But the first imitation of words does not show that the
little mind has seized their full and precise meaning. A
clear and exact apprehension of meaning comes but slowly,
and only as the result of many hard thought-processes,
comparisons and discriminations.</p>

<p class='c001'>In these first attempts to use our speech, the child’s
mind is innocent of grammatical distinctions. These arise
out of the particular uses of words in sentence-structure,
and of this structure the child has as yet no inkling. If,
then, following a common practice, I speak of a child of
twelve or fifteen months as <em>naming</em> an object, the reader
must not suppose that I am ascribing to the baby-mind
a clear grasp of the function of what grammarians call
nouns (substantives). All that is implied in this way of
speaking, is that the infant’s first words are used mainly as
recognition-signs. There is from the first, I conceive, even
in the gesture of pointing and saying ‘da!’ a germ of this
naming process.</p>

<p class='c001'>The progress of this rude naming or articulate recognition
is very interesting. The names first learnt are either
those of individuals, what we call proper names, as
‘mamma,’ ‘nurse,’ or those which, like ‘bath,’ ‘bow-wow,’
are at first applied to one particular object. It is often
supposed that a child uses these as true singular names,
recognising individual objects as such. But this is pretty
certainly an error. He cannot note differences well enough
or grasp a sufficient number of differential marks to know
an individual as such, and he will, as occasion arises, quite
spontaneously extend his names to other things which
happen to have some interesting and notable points in
common with the first. Thus ‘bow-wow,’ though first
applied to one particular dog, is, as we know, at once extended
to other dogs, pictures of dogs, and not infrequently
other things as well. If then we speak of the child as
generalising or widening the application of his terms, we
must not be taken to mean that he goes through a process
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>of comparing things which he perceives to be distinct, and
discovering a likeness in these, but that he merely assimilates
or recognises something like that which he has seen
before without troubling to note the differences.</p>

<p class='c001'>This extension of names or generalising process proceeds
primarily and mainly by the feeling for the likenesses or the
common aspects of things, though as we shall see presently
their connexions of time and place afford a second and
subordinate means of extension. The transference of a
name from object to object through this apprehension of a
likeness or assimilation has already been touched upon. It
moves along thoroughly childish lines, and constitutes one
of the most striking and interesting of the manifestations
of precocious originality. Yet if unconventional in its mode
of operation it is essentially thought-activity, a connecting
of like with like, and a rudimentary grouping of things in
classes.</p>

<p class='c001'>This tendency to comprehend like things or situations
under a single articulate sign is seen already in the use of
the early indicative sign ‘atta’ (all gone). It was used by
Preyer’s child to mark not only the departure of a thing
but the putting out of a flame, later on, an empty glass
or other vessel. By another child it was extended to the
ending of music, the closing of a drawer and so on. Here,
however, the various applications probably answer more to
a common feeling of ending or missing than to an apprehension
of a common objective situation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Coming to words which we call names we find that the
child will often extend a recognition-sign from one object
to a second, and to our thinking widely dissimilar object
through the discovery of some analogy. Such extension,
moving rather along poetic lines than those of our logical
classifications, is apt, as we have seen, to wear a quaint
metaphorical aspect. A star, for example, looked at, I
suppose, as a small bright spot, was called by one child an
eye. The child M. called the opal globe of a lighted lamp
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>a ‘moon’. ‘Pin’ was extended by another child to a crumb
just picked up, a fly, and a caterpillar, and seemed to mean
something little to be taken between the fingers. The same
child used the sound ‘’at’ (hat) for anything put on the
head, including a hair-brush. Another child used the word
‘key’ for other bright metal things, as money. Romanes’
child extended the word ‘star,’ the first vocable learned
after ‘Mamma’ and ‘Papa,’ to bright objects generally,
candles, gas-flames, etc. Taine speaks of a child of one
year who after first applying the word “fafer” (from
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“chemin de fer”</span>) to railway engines went on to transfer
it to a steaming coffee-pot and everything that hissed or
smoked or made a noise. In these last illustrations we
have plainly a rudimentary process of classification. Any
point of likeness, provided it is of sufficient interest to
strike the attention, may thus serve as a basis of childish
classification.</p>

<p class='c001'>As with names of things so with those of actions. The
crackling noise of the fire was called by one child ‘barking,’
and the barking of a dog was named by another ‘coughing’.
We see from this that the particular line of analogical extension
followed by a child will depend on the nature of
the first impressions or experiences which serve as his
starting point.</p>

<p class='c001'>A like originality is apt to show itself in the first crude
attempt to seize and name the relations of things. The
child C. called dipping bread in gravy ‘ba’ (bath). Another
child extended the word ‘door’ to “everything that stopped
up an opening or prevented an exit, including the
cork of a bottle, and the little table that fastened him in
his high chair”.</p>

<p class='c001'>In these extensions we see the tendency of child-thought
towards ‘concretism,’ or the use of a simple concrete idea in
order to express a more abstract idea. Children frequently
express the contrast big, little, by the pretty figurative
language ‘Mamma’ and ‘baby’. Thus a small coin was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>called by an American child a ‘baby dollar’. Romanes’
daughter, named Ilda, pointed out the sheep in a picture
as ‘Mamma-ba’ and the lambs as ‘Ilda-ba’. It is somewhat
the same process when the child extends an idea
obtained from the most impressive experience of childish
difficulty, <i>viz.</i>, ‘too big,’ so as to make it do duty for the
abstract notion ‘too difficult’ in general.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this extension of language by the child we may
discern, along with this play of the feeling for similarity,
the working of association. This is illustrated by the case
of Darwin’s grandchild, who when just beginning to speak
used the common sign ‘quack’ for duck, then extended this
to water, then, following up this associative transference by
a double process of generalisation, made the sound serve
as the name of all birds and insects on the one hand, and
all fluid substances on the other.<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c011'><sup>[93]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The transference of the name ‘quack’ from the animal
to the water is a striking example of the tendency of the
young mind to view things which are presented together
as belonging one to another and in a manner identical.
Another curious instance is given by Professor Minto, in
which a child, who applied the word ‘mambro’ to her
nurse, went on to extend it by associative transference to the
nurse’s sewing machine, then by analogy applied it to a
hand-organ in the street, later on, through an association
of hand-organ with monkey, to his india-rubber monkey.
Here we have a whole history of change of word-meaning
illustrating in curiously equal measure the play of
assimilation and of association, and falling within a period
of two years.<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c011'><sup>[94]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>There is another way in which children are said to
‘extend’ names somewhat analogous to the processes of
assimilation and associate transference. They are very
fond of using the same word for opposed or other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>correlative ideas. In some cases we can see that this is
due merely to confusion or want of discrimination. When,
for example, Preyer’s boy confused ‘too little’ with ‘too
much,’ and ‘yesterday’ with ‘to-morrow,’ going so far as
to make a compound <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">‘heitgestern’</span> (<i>i.e.</i>, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">heutegestern</span>) to
include both,<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c011'><sup>[95]</sup></a> it is easy to see that the child’s mind had
reached merely the vague idea unsuitable in quantity in
the one case, and time not present in the other; and that
he failed to differentiate these ideas. In other cases where
correlatives are confused, as when a child extended the
sign of asking for an eatable (‘bit-ye’) to the act of offering
anything to another, or when as in C.’s case ‘spend’
was made to do duty for ‘cost,’ ‘borrow’ for ‘lend,’ and
‘learn’ for ‘teach,’ the explanation is slightly different.
A child can only acquire an idea of abstract relations
slowly and by stages. Such words as <em>lend</em>, <em>teach</em>, call
up first a pictorial idea of an action in which two persons
are seen to be concerned. But the exact nature of the
relation, and the difference in its aspect as we start from
the one or the other term, are not perceived. Thus in
thinking of a purchase over the counter, a child may be
supposed to image the action but not clearly to distinguish
the part taken by the person who buys and gives out money
(‘spends’) and the part taken by the person who demands
a price or fixes the cost. Perhaps we get near this vague
awareness of a relation when we are aiding a violinist to
tune his instrument. We may know that his note and our
piano note do not accord, and yet be quite unable to determine
their exact relation, and to fix the one as higher, the
other as lower.</p>

<p class='c001'>An interesting variety of this extension of names to
correlatives is the transference of the attributes of causal
agent to passive object, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vice versâ</i></span>. Thus a little girl
of four called her parasol when blown by the wind ‘a windy
parasol,’ and a stone that made her hand sore ‘a very sore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>stone’. A little Italian girl that had taken some nasty
medicines expressed the fact by calling herself nasty
(<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">‘bimba cattiva’</span>).<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c011'><sup>[96]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>There is much in the whole of these changes introduced
by the child into the uses or meanings of words which may
remind one of the changes which go on in the growth of
languages in communities. Thus the child’s metaphorical
use of words, his setting forth of an abstract idea by some
analogous concrete image, has its counterpart, as we know,
in the early stages of human language. Tribes which have
no abstract signs employ a metaphor exactly as the child
does. Our own language preserves the traces of this early
figurative use of words; as in ‘imbecile,’ weak, which
originally meant leaning on a staff, and so forth.<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c011'><sup>[97]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Again, we may trace in the development of languages
the counterpart of those processes by which children
spontaneously expand what logicians call the denotation
of their names. The word ‘sun’ has only quite recently
undergone this kind of extension by being applied to other
centres of systems besides our familiar sun. The multiplicity
of meanings of certain words, as ‘post,’ ‘stock’ and
so forth, points to the double process of assimilative and
associative extension which we saw illustrated in the use
of the child’s word ‘mambro’.</p>

<p class='c001'>Once more, the child’s extension of a word from an
idea to its correlative has its parallel in the adult’s use of
language. As the vulgar expression ‘I’ll larn you’ shows
(<i>cf.</i> the Anglo-Saxon <em>leornian</em>), a word may come to mean
both to teach and to become taught. A like embracing
of agent and object acted upon by the same word is seen
in the ‘active’ and ‘passive’ meanings of words like the
Latin <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>penetrabilis</i></span> (‘piercing’ and ‘pierceable’), and in the
‘objective’ and ‘subjective’ meanings of ‘pleasant’ and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>similar words. We are beginning, like the little girl
quoted above, to speak of a ‘sore’ topic. Lastly, the
movement of thought underlying the saying of the little
Italian girl, ‘nasty baby,’ seems to be akin to that of the
savage when he supposes that he appropriates the qualities
of that which he eats.</p>

<p class='c001'>The changes here touched upon have to do with what
philologists call generalisation. As supplementary to these
there is in the case of the growth of a community-language
a process of specialisation, as when ‘physician’ from
meaning a student of nature has come to mean one who
has acquired and can practically apply one branch of nature-knowledge.
In the case of the child we have an analogue
of this in the gradual limitation of names to narrower
classes or to individuals as the result of carrying out certain
processes of comparison and discrimination. Thus ‘ba-ba,’
which is used at first for a miscellaneous crowd of woolly
or hairy quadrupeds, gets specialised as a name for a sheep,
and the much-abused ‘papa’ becomes restricted to its
rightful owner.</p>

<p class='c001'>This process of differentiation and specialisation assumes
an interesting form in a characteristic feature of the language-invention
of both children and savages, <i>viz.</i>, the formation of
compound words. These compounds are often true metaphors.
Thus in the case already quoted where an eye-lid was
called an eye-curtain the child may be said to have resorted
to a metaphorical way of describing the lid. It is much the
same when M. at the age of one year nine months invented
the expression ‘bwite (bright) penny’ for silver pieces. A
slightly different example is the compound ‘foot-wing’
invented by the child C. to describe the limb of a seal. As
a further variety of this metaphoric formation I may quote
the pretty name ‘tell-wind’ which a boy of four years and
eight months hit upon as a name for the weather-vane.</p>

<p class='c001'>In these and similar cases, there is at once an analogical
transference of meaning (<i>e.g.</i>, from curtain to lid) or process
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>of generalisation, and a limitation of meaning by the
appended or qualifying word ‘eye’ and so a process of
specialisation.</p>

<p class='c001'>In certain cases the analogical extension gives place
to what we should call a classification. One child for
example, knowing the word steam-ship and wanting the
name sailing-ship, invented the form ‘wind-ship’. The little
girl M., when one year and nine months old, showed quite
a passion for classing by help of compounds, arranging the
rooms into ‘morner-room,’ ‘dinner-room’  (she was fond of
adding ‘er’ at this time) and ‘nursery-room’.</p>

<p class='c001'>It might be supposed from a logical point of view that
in these inventions the qualifying or determining word would
come more naturally after the generic name, as in the French
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>moulin à vent, cygne noir</i></span>. I have heard of one English
child who used the form ‘mill-wind’ in preference to ‘wind-mill,’
and the order ‘dog black’ in preference to ‘black dog’.
It would be worth while to note any similar instances.</p>

<p class='c001'>In these inventions, again, we may detect a close resemblance
between children’s language and that of savages. In
presence of a new object a savage behaves very much as a
child, he shapes a new name out of familiar ones, a name
that commonly has much of the metaphorical character.
Thus the Aztecs called a boat a ‘water-house’; and the
Vancouver islanders when they saw a screw-steamer called
it the ‘kick-kicket’.<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c011'><sup>[98]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>A somewhat different class of word-inventions is that
in which a child frames a new word on the analogy
of known words. A common case is the invention
of new substantives from verbs after the pattern of other
substantives. The results are often quaint enough. Sometimes
it is the agent who is named by the new word, as
when the boy C. talked of the ‘Rainer,’ the fairy who
makes rain, or when another little boy dubbed a teacher
the ‘lessoner’. Sometimes it is the product of the action
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>that is named, as when the same child C. and the deaf-mute
Laura Bridgman both invented the form ‘thinks’ for
‘thoughts’. In much the same way a boy of three called
the holes which he dug in his garden his ‘digs’. The reverse
process, the formation of a verb from a substantive,
also occurs. Thus one child invented the form ‘dag’ for
striking with a dagger; and Preyer’s boy when two years
and two months old formed the verb <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">‘messen’</span> to express
cut from the substantive <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">‘messer’</span> (a knife). It was
probably a similar process when the child M. at one year
ten months, after seeing a motionless worm and being told
that it was dead, asked to see another worm ‘deading’.
The same child coined the neat verb-form ‘unparcel’.
This readiness to form verbs from substantives and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vice
versâ</i></span>, which is abundantly illustrated in the development
of language, is without doubt connected with the primitive
and natural mode of thinking. The object is of greatest
interest both to the child and to primitive man as an agent,
or as the last stage or result of an action.</p>

<p class='c001'>In certain of these original formations we may detect
a fine feeling for verbal analogy. Thus a French boy,
after killing the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘limaces’</span> (snails) which were eating
the plants in the garden, dignified his office by styling
himself a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘limarcier’</span>; where the inventive faculty was no
doubt led by the analogy of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘voiturier’</span> formed from
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘voiture’</span>.<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c011'><sup>[99]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In other verbal formations it is difficult to determine
the model which is followed. Signorina Lombroso
gives a good example. A little girl of two and a half
years had observed that when her mother allowed her
to take, eat, or drink something, she would say ‘prendilo’
(take it), ‘bevilo’ (drink it), or ‘mangialo’ (eat it). She proceeded
to make a kind of adjective or substantive out of
each of these, asking <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">‘é prendilo?’ ‘é bevilo?’ ‘é mangialo?’</span>
<i>i.e.</i>, ‘Is it takable or a case of taking?’ etc., when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>she wanted to take, drink, or eat something.<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c011'><sup>[100]</sup></a> By such
skilful artifices does the little word-builder find his way to
the names which he has need of.</p>

<p class='c001'>In certain cases these original constructions are of a
more clumsy order and due to a partial forgetfulness of a
word and an effort to complete it. Thus a boy of four
spoke of being ‘sorrified,’ where he was evidently led out of
the right track by the analogy of ‘horrified’. The same little
boy who talked of his ‘digs’ used the word ‘magnicious’
for ‘magnificent’. This is a choice example of word-transformation.
No doubt the child was led by the feeling
for the sound of this termination in other grand words, as
‘ambitious’. Possible, too, he might have heard the form
‘magnesia’ and been influenced by a reminiscence of this
sound-complex. The talk of ‘Jeames’ with which Mr.
Punch makes us acquainted is full of just such delightful
missings of the mark in trying to reproduce big words.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><i>Sentence-building.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>We may now follow the child in his later and more
ambitious linguistic efforts. The transition to this higher
plane is marked by the use of the completed form of
thought, the sentence.</p>

<p class='c001'>At first, as already pointed out, there is no sentence-structure.
The child begins to talk by using single words.
These words consist of what we call substantives, as
‘Mamma,’ ‘nurse,’ ‘milk,’ a few adjectives, as ‘hot,’ ‘nice,’
‘good,’ a still smaller number of adverbial signs, as ‘ta-ta,’
or ‘away,’ ‘over,’ ‘down,’ ‘up,’ and one or two verb-forms,
apparently imperatives, as ‘go’. The exact order in
which these appear, and the proportion between the
different classes of constituents at a particular age, say
two and a half or three, appear to vary greatly. Words
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>descriptive of actions, though very few at first, appear to
grow numerous in a later stage.<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c011'><sup>[101]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In speaking of these words as substantives, adjectives,
and so forth, I am merely adopting a convenient mode of
description. We must not suppose that the words as used
in this simple disjointed talk have their full grammatical
value. It is not generally recognised that the single-worded
utterance of the child is an abbreviated sentence or
‘sentence-word’ analogous to the sentence-words found in
the simplest known stage of adult language. As with the race
so with the child, the sentence precedes the word. Moreover,
each of the child’s so-called words in his single-worded
talk stands for a considerable variety of sentence-forms.
Thus the words in the child’s vocabulary which we call
substantives do duty for verbs and so forth. As Preyer
remarks, ‘chair’ (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">stuhl</span>) means ‘There is no chair,’ ‘I
want to be put in the chair,’ ‘The chair is broken,’ and
so forth. In like manner ‘dow’ (down) may mean ‘The
spoon has fallen down,’ ‘I am down,’ ‘I want to go down,’
etc.<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c011'><sup>[102]</sup></a> The particular shade of meaning intended is indicated
by intonation and gesture.</p>

<p class='c001'>This sentence-construction begins with a certain
timidity. The age at which it is first observed varies
greatly. It seems in most cases to be somewhere about
the twenty-first month, yet I find good observers among
my correspondents giving as dates eighteen and a half
and nineteen months; and a friend of mine, a Professor
of Literature, tells me that his boy formed simple
sentences as early as fifteen months. We commonly have
at first quite short sentences formed by two words in
apposition. These may consist of what we should call
an adjective added to and qualifying a substantive, as
in the simple utterance of the child C., ‘Big bir’ (bird),
or the exclamation, ‘Papa no’ (Papa’s nose); or they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>may arise by a combination of substantives, as in the
sentence given by Tracy, ‘Papa cacker,’ <i>i.e.</i>, ‘Papa has
crackers,’ and one quoted by Preyer, ‘Auntie cake’
(German, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">‘Danna Kuha,’</span> <i>i.e.</i>, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">‘Tante Kuche’</span>) for ‘Auntie
has given me cake’; and in a somewhat different example
of a compound sentence also given by Preyer, ‘Home
milk’ (German, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">‘Haim Mimi’</span>), interpreted as ‘I want to
go home and have milk’. In the case of one child about
the age of twenty-three months most of the sentences were
composed of two words, one of which was a verb in the
imperative. The love of commanding, so strong in the
child, makes the use of the imperative, as is seen in this
case, very common. M.’s first performance in sentence-building
(at eighteen and a half months) was, ‘Mamma,
tie,’ <i>i.e.</i>, ‘tie gloves’.</p>

<p class='c001'>Little by little the learner manages longer sentences,
economising his resources to the utmost, troubling nothing
about inflections or the insertion of prepositions so as to
indicate precise relations, but leaving his hearer to discover
his meaning as best he may; and it is truly wonderful
how much the child manages to express in this rude
fashion. A boy nineteen and a half months old gave this
elaborate order to his father: ‘Dada toe toe ba,’ that is,
‘Dada is to go and put his toes in the bath’. Pollock’s
little girl in the first essay at sentence-building, recorded
at the age of twenty-one and a half months, actually
managed a neat antithesis: ‘Cabs dati, clam clin,’ that is
to say, ‘Cabs are dirty, and the perambulator is clean’.
Preyer’s boy in the beginning of the third year brought
out the following, ‘Mimi atta teppa papa oi,’ that is to say,
‘Milch atta Teppich Papa fui,’ which appears to have
signified, “The milk is gone, it is on the carpet, and papa
said ‘Fie’”. It may be added that the difficulties of
deciphering these early sentences is aggravated by the
frequent resort to slurs, as when a child says, ‘m’ out’ for
‘take me out,’ ‘’t on’ for ‘put it on’.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>The order of words in these first tentative sentences
is noticeable. Sometimes the subject is placed after
the predicate, as in an example given by Pollock,
‘Run away man,’ <i>i.e.</i>, ‘The man runs (or has run) away,’
and in the still quainter example given by the same writer,
‘Out-pull-baby ’pecs (spectacles),’ <i>i.e.</i>, ‘Baby pulls or will
pull out the spectacles’. In like manner the adjective
used as predicate may precede the subject, as in the
examples given by Maillet, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘Jolie la fleur,’</span> etc.<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c011'><sup>[103]</sup></a> Sometimes,
again, the object comes before the verb, as apparently
in the following example given by Miss Shinn:
a little girl delighted at the prospect of going out to see
the moon exclaimed, “Moo-ky (sky), baby shee (see)”.<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c011'><sup>[104]</sup></a>
Here is a delightful example of a transposition of subject
and object. A boy two years and three months asked,
‘Did Ack (Alec) chocke an apple?’ <i>i.e.</i>, ‘Did an apple
choke Alec?’ though in this case we very probably have to
do with a misunderstanding of the action choke. Other
kinds of inversion occur when more complex experiments
are attempted, as in connecting ‘my’ with an adjective.
Thus one child said prettily, ‘Poor my friends’;<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c011'><sup>[105]</sup></a> which
archaic form may be compared with the following Gallic-looking
idiom used by M. at the age of one year ten
months: ‘How Babba (baby, <i>i.e.</i>, herself) does feed nicely!’
The same little girl put the auxiliary out of its place,
saying, ‘Tan (can) Babba wite’ for ‘Baby can write,’
though this was probably a reminiscence of the question-form.</p>

<p class='c001'>These inversions of our familiar order are suggestive.
They have some resemblance to the curious order which
appears in the spontaneous sign-making of deaf-mutes.
Thus a deaf-mute answered the question, ‘Who made God?’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>by saying, “God made nothing,” <i>i.e.</i>, “nothing made God”.
Similarly the deaf-mute Laura Bridgman expressed the
petition, ‘Give Laura bread,’ by the form, ‘Laura bread
give.’<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c011'><sup>[106]</sup></a> Such inversions, as we know, are allowable and
common in certain languages, <i>e.g.</i>, Latin. The study of the
syntax of child-language and of the sign-making of deaf-mutes
might suggest that our English order is not in certain
cases the most natural one.</p>

<p class='c001'>A somewhat similar inversion of what seems to us the
proper order appears in the child’s first attempts at negation.
The child C. early in his third year expressed the idea that
he was not going into the sea thus: ‘N. (his own name) go
in water, no’. Similarly Pollock’s child expressed acquiescence
in a prohibition in this manner, ‘Baby have
papa (pepper) no,’ where the ‘no’ followed without a pause.
The same order appears in the case of French children, <i>e.g.</i>,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘Papa non,’</span> <i>i.e.</i>, ‘It is not Papa,’ and seems to be a common,
if not a universal form of the first half-spontaneous sentence-building.
Here again we see an analogy to the syntax of
deaf-mutes, who appear to append the sign of negation in
a similar way, <i>e.g.</i>, ‘Teacher I beat, deceive, scold no,’ <i>i.e.</i>,
‘I must not beat, deceive, scold my teacher’. We see
something like it, too, in the formations of savage-languages,
as when ‘fool no’ comes to be the sign of ‘not fool,’ that is
of wise.<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c011'><sup>[107]</sup></a> When ‘not’ comes into use it is apt to be put in
a wrong place, as when the little girl M. said, ‘No Babba
look’ (<i>i.e.</i>, ‘Babba will not look’), and ‘Mr. Dill not did tum’
for ‘Mr. Gill did not come’.<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c011'><sup>[108]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Another closely related characteristic of this early
childish sentence-building is the love of antithesis under the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>form of two balancing statements. Thus a child will often
oppose an affirmative to a negative statement as a means of
bringing out the full meaning of the former. The boy C.,
for example, would say, ‘This a nice bow-wow, not nasty
bow-wow’. The little girl M. said, ‘Boo (the name of her
cat) dot (got) tail; poor Babba dot no tail,’ proceeding to
search for a tail under her skirts. This use of a negative
statement by way of contrast or opposition to an affirmative
grew in the case of one child aged two years and two
months into a habit of description by negations. Thus an
orange was described by the saying, ‘No, ’tisn’t apple,’
porridge by ‘No, ’tisn’t bread and milk’. It is interesting
to note that deaf-mutes proceed in a similar fashion by way
of antithetic negative statement. Thus one of these expressed
the thought, ‘I must love and honour my teacher,’
by the order, ‘Teacher I beat, deceive, scold no!—I love
honour yes!’<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c011'><sup>[109]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>These first essays in the construction of sentences illustrate
the skill of the child in eking out his scanty vocabulary
by help of a metaphorical transference of meaning. Taine
gives a charming example of this device. A little girl
of eighteen months had acquired the word ‘Coucou’ as
used by her mother or nurse when playfully hiding behind
a door or chair, and the expression <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘ça brûle’</span> as employed
to warn her that her dinner was too hot, or that she must
put on her hat in the garden to keep off the hot sun. One
day on seeing the sun disappear behind a hill she exclaimed,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘A bûle coucou’</span>.<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c011'><sup>[110]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It is a fearful moment when the child first tries his hand
at inflections, and, more especially in our language, those
of verbs. Pollock’s child made the attempt, and successfully,
at the age of twenty-two months. Such first essays
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>are probably examples of pure imitation, the precise forms
used having been previously heard from others. Hence
while they show a growing power of thought, of a differencing
of the relations of number and time, they do not involve
verbal construction properly so called. This last appears
as soon as the child carries over his knowledge of particular
cases of verbal inflection and applies it to new words.
This involves a nascent appreciation of the reason or rule
according to which words are modified. The development
of this feeling for the general mode of verbal change underlies
all the later advance in correct speaking.</p>

<p class='c001'>While the little explorer in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>terra incognita</i></span> of language
can proceed safely in this direction up to a certain
point he is apt, as we all know, to stumble now and again;
nor is this to be wondered at when we remember the intricacies,
the irregularities, which characterise a language
like ours. In trying, for example, to manage the preterite
of an English verb he is certain, as, indeed, is the foreigner,
to go wrong. The direction of the error is often in the
transformation of the weak to the strong form; as when
‘screamed’ becomes ‘scram,’ ‘split’ (preterite) ‘splat’ or
‘splut,’ and so forth. In other cases the child wall convert
a strong into a weak form, as when Laura Bridgman, like
many another child, would say, ‘I eated,’ ‘I seed,’ and so
forth.<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c011'><sup>[111]</sup></a> Sometimes, again, delightful doublings of the past
tense occur, as ‘sawed’ for ‘saw,’ ‘eatened’ for ‘eaten,’
‘didn’t saw’ for ‘didn’t see,’ ‘did you gave me?’ for ‘did
you give me?’ Active and passive forms are sometimes
confused, as when M. said ‘not yike being picking up’ for
‘not like being picked up,’ etc. It is curious to note the
different lines of imitative construction followed out in these
cases.</p>

<p class='c001'>One thing seems clear here: the child’s instinct is to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>simplify our forms, to get rid of irregularities. This is
strikingly illustrated in the use of the heterogeneous
assemblage of forms known as the verb ‘to be’. It is
really hard on a child to expect him to answer the question,
‘Are you good now?’ by saying, ‘Yes, I am’. He says, of
course, ‘Yes, I are’. Perhaps the poor verb ‘to be’ has
suffered every kind of violence at the hands of children.<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c011'><sup>[112]</sup></a>
Thus the child M. used the form ‘bēd’ for ‘was’. Professor
Max Müller somewhere says that children are the
purifiers of language. Would it not be well if they could
become its simplifiers also, and give us in place of this congeries
of unrelated sounds one good decent verb-form?</p>

<p class='c001'>Other quaint transformations occur when the child
begins to combine words, as when M. joining adverb to
verb invented the form of past tense ‘fall downed’ for
‘fell down’. Another queer form is ‘Am’t I?’ used for
‘am I not?’ after the pattern of ‘aren’t we?’ An even
finer linguistic stroke than this, is ‘Bettern’t you?’ for
‘Had you not better?’ where the child was evidently
trying to get in the form ‘hadn’t you,’ along with the
awkward ‘better,’ which seemed to belong to the ‘had,’
and solved the problem by treating ‘better’ as the verb,
and dropping ‘had’ altogether.</p>

<p class='c001'>A study of these solecisms, which are nearly always
amusing, and sometimes daintily pretty, is useful to mothers
and young teachers by way of showing how much hard
work, how much of real conjectural inference, enters into
children’s essays in talking. We ought not to wonder
that they now and again slip; rather ought we to wonder
that, with all the intricacies and pitfalls of our language—this
applies of course with especial force to the motley
irregular English tongue—they slip so rarely. As a matter
of fact, the latter and more ‘correct’ talk—which is correct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>just because the child has stored up a good stock of particular
word-forms, and consequently has a much wider
range of pure uninventive imitation—is less admirable than
the early inventive imitation; for this last not only has the
quality of originality, but shows the germ of a truly grammatical
feeling for the general types or norms of the
language.</p>

<p class='c001'>The English child is not much troubled by inflections
of substantives. The pronouns, however, as intelligent
mothers know, are apt to cause much heart-burning to the
little linguist. The mastery of ‘I’ and ‘you,’ ‘me,’ <a id='corr178.11'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='mine,’'>‘mine,’</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_178.11'><ins class='correction' title='mine,’'>‘mine,’</ins></a></span>
etc., forms an epoch in the development of the linguistic
faculty and of the power of thought which is so closely
correlated with this. Hence it will repay a brief inspection.</p>

<p class='c001'>As is well known, children begin by speaking of themselves
and of those whom they address by names, as when
they say, ‘Baby good,’ ‘Mamma come’. This is sometimes
described as speaking “in the third person,” yet this is not
quite accurate, seeing that there is as yet no distinction of
person at all in the child’s language.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first use of ‘I’ and ‘you’ between two and
three years is apt to be erroneous. The child proceeds
imitatively to use ‘I,’ ‘me,’ ‘my’ for ‘you’ and ‘your’.
Thus one child said, ‘What I’m going to do,’ for,
‘What are you going to do?’ In this case, it is plain,
there is no clear grasp of what we mean by subject, or
of the exact relation of this subject to the person he is
addressing.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet along with this mechanical repetition of the
pronominal forms we see the beginnings of an intelligent
use of them. So far as I can ascertain most
children begin to say ‘me’ or ‘my’ before they say
‘you’. Yet I have met with one or two apparent exceptions
to this rule. Thus the boy C. certainly seemed
to get hold of the form of the second person before that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>of the first, and the priority of ‘you’ is attested in another
case sent to me. It is desirable to get more observations
on this point.</p>

<p class='c001'>To determine the exact date at which an intelligent use
of the first person appears, is much less easy than it looks.
The ‘I’ is apt to appear momentarily and then disappear,
as when M. at the age of nineteen months three
weeks was observed to say ‘I did’ once, though she did
not use ‘I’ again until some time afterwards. Allowing
for these difficulties it may be said with some degree of
confidence that the great transition from ‘baby’ to ‘I’ is
wont to take place in favourable cases early in the first half
of the third year. Thus among the dates assigned by different
observers I find, twenty-four months, twenty-five months
(cases given by Preyer), between twenty-five and twenty-six
(Pollock), twenty-seven months (the boy C.). A lady
friend tells me that her boy began to use ‘I’ at twenty-four
months. In the case of a certain number of precocious
children this point is attained at an earlier date. Thus
Preyer quotes a case of a child speaking in the first person
at twenty months. Schultze gives a case at nineteen
months. A friend of mine, a Professor of English Literature,
whose boy showed great precocity in sentence-building,
reports that he used the forms ‘me’ and ‘I’ within the
sixteenth month. Preyer’s boy, on the other hand, who
was evidently somewhat slow in lingual development, first
used the form of the first person ‘to me’ (mir) at the age
of twenty-nine months.</p>

<p class='c001'>The precise way in which these pronominal forms first
appear is very curious. Many children use ‘me’ before ‘I’.
Preyer’s boy appears to have first used the form ‘to me’
(mir). ‘My’ too is apt to appear among the earliest forms.
In such different ways does the child pass to the new and
difficult region of pronominal speech.</p>

<p class='c001'>The meaning of this transition has given rise to much
discussion. It is plain, to begin with, that a child cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>acquire these forms as he acquires the name ‘papa,’
‘nurse,’ by a direct and comparatively mechanical mode
of imitation. When he does imitate in this fashion he
produces, as we have seen, the absurdity of speaking of
himself as ‘you’. Hence during the first year or so of
speech he makes no use of these forms. He speaks of
himself as ‘baby’ or some equivalent name, others coming
down to his level and setting him the example.</p>

<p class='c001'>The transition seems to be due in part, as I have
elsewhere pointed out, to a growing self-consciousness, to a
clearer singling out of the <em>ego</em> or self as the centre of
thought and activity, and the understanding of the other
‘persons’ in relation to this centre. Not that self-consciousness
<em>begins</em> with the use of ‘I’. The child has no
doubt a rudimentary self-consciousness when he talks
about himself as about another object: yet the use of the
forms ‘I,’ ‘me,’ may be taken to mark the greater precision
of the idea of ‘self’ as not merely a bodily object and
nameable just like other sensible things, but as something
distinct from and opposed to all objects of sense, as what
we call the ‘subject’ or <em>ego</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>While, however, we may set down this exchange of the
proper name for the forms ‘I’ and ‘me’ as due to the
spontaneous growth of the child’s intelligence, it is possible
that education exerts its influence too. It is conjecturable
that as a child’s intelligence grows, others in speaking
to him tend unknowingly to introduce the forms ‘I’ and
‘you’ more frequently. Yet I am disposed to think that
the child commonly takes the lead here. However this
be, it is clear that growing intelligence, involving greater
interest in others’ words, will lead to a closer attention to
these pronominal forms as employed by others. In this
way the environment works on the growing mind of the
child, stimulating it to direct its thoughts to these subtle
relations of the ‘me and not me,’ ‘mine and thine’. The
more intelligent the environment the greater will be the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>stimulating influence: hence, in part at least, the difference
of age when the new style of speech is attained.<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c011'><sup>[113]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The acquirement of these pronominal forms is a slow
and irksome business. At first they are introduced hesitatingly,
and alongside of the proper name; the child,
for example, saying sometimes, ‘Baby’ or ‘Ilda,’ sometimes
‘I’ or ‘me’. In some cases, again, the two forms are
used at the same time in apposition, as in the delightful
form not unknown in older folk’s language, ‘Hilda, my
book’. The forms ‘I’ and ‘me’ are, moreover, confined
at first to a few expressions, as ‘I am,’ ‘I went,’ and so
forth. The dropping of the old forms, as may be seen by
a glance at the notes on the child C., and at Preyer’s
methodical diary, is a gradual process.</p>

<p class='c001'>Quaint solecisms mark the first stages of the use of
these pronouns. As in the case of the earlier use of
substantives, one and the same form will be used economically
for a variety of meanings, as when ‘me’ was by
the boy C. used to do duty for ‘mine’ also, and ‘us’ for
‘ours’. Here it is probable there is a lack of perfect discrimination.
The connexion between the self and its belongings
is for all of us of the closest. When a child of two,
who was about to be deprived of her doll, shouted, ‘Me,
me!’ may we not suppose that the doll was taken up into
the inner circle of the self?<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c011'><sup>[114]</sup></a> Sometimes in this enrichment
of the vocabulary by pronouns new and delightful forms
are struck off, as when the little experimenter invents the
possessive form ‘she’s’.</p>

<p class='c001'>The perfect unfettered use of these puzzling forms
comes much later. Preyer quotes a case in which a child
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>Olga, aged four years, would say, ‘She has made me wet,’
meaning that she herself had done it. But this perhaps
points to that tendency to split up the self into a number
of personalities, to which reference was made in an earlier
essay.</p>

<p class='c001'>The third year, which witnesses the important addition
of the pronouns, sees other refinements introduced. Thus
the definite article was introduced in the case of Preyer’s
boy in the twenty-eighth month, in that of an English boy
at the age of two years eight months. Prepositions are
introduced about the same time. In this way childish
talk begins to lose its primitive disjointed character, and
to grow into an articulated structure.<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c011'><sup>[115]</sup></a> Yet the perfect
mastery of these takes time. A feeling for analogy easily
leads the little explorer astray at first, as when the child
M. said ‘far to’ after the model ‘near to’.</p>

<p class='c001'>Through this whole period of language-learning the
child continues to show his originality, his inventiveness.
He is rarely at a loss, and though the gaps in his verbal
acquisitions are great he is very skilful in filling them up.
If, for example, our bright little linguist M., at the age of
one year eight and a half months, after being jumped by
her father, wants him to jump her mother also, she says, in
default of the word ‘jump,’ “Make mamma high”. A boy
of twenty-seven months ingeniously said, ‘It rains off,’ for
‘The rain has left off’. Forms are sometimes combined,
as when a boy of three years three months used ‘my lone,’
‘your lone,’ for ‘me alone’ or ‘by myself,’ ‘you alone’ or
‘by yourself’. Another girl, two years ten months, said,
‘No two ’tatoes left,’ meaning ‘only one potato is left’.
Pleonasms occur in abundance, as when a boy of two
would say, ‘Another one bicca (biscuit),’ and, better still,
‘another more’.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>
  <h3 class='c017'><i>Getting at our Meanings.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>There is one part of this child’s work of learning our
language of which I have said hardly anything, <i>viz.</i>, the
divining of the verbal content, of the meaning we put or try
to put into our words. A brief reference to this may well
bring this study of childish linguistics to a close.</p>

<p class='c001'>The least attention to a child in the act of language-learning
will show how much of downright hard work goes
to the understanding of language. If we are to judge by
the effort required we might say that the child does as
much in deciphering his mother-tongue as an Oriental
scholar in deciphering a system of hieroglyphics. Just think,
for example, how many careful comparisons the small child-brain
has to carry out, comparisons of the several uses of
the word by others in varying circumstances, before he can
get anything approaching to a clear idea, answering even
to such seemingly simple words as ‘clean,’ ‘old’ or ‘clever’.
The way in which inquiring children plague us with questions
of the form, ‘What does such and such a word mean?’
sufficiently shows how much thought-activity goes in the
trying to get at meanings. This difficulty, moreover,
persists, reappearing in new forms as the child pushes his
way onwards into the more tangled tracts of the lingual
terrain. It is felt, and felt keenly, too, when most of the
torments of articulation are over and forgotten. Many of
us can remember how certain words haunted us as uncanny
forms into the nature of which we tried hard, but in vain, to
penetrate.</p>

<p class='c001'>Owing to these difficulties the little learner is always
drifting into misunderstanding of words. Such misapprehensions
will arise in a passive way by the mere play of
association in attaching the word especially to some striking
feature or circumstance which is apt to present itself when the
word is used in the child’s hearing. In this way, for example,
general terms may become terribly restricted in range
by the incorporation of accidentals into their meaning, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>when a Sunday school scholar rendered the story of the
good Samaritan by saying that a gentleman came by and
poured some paraffin (<i>i.e.</i>, oil) over the poor man. A word
may have its meaning funnily transformed by such associative
suggestions, as when a little girl, being told that a
thing was a secret, remarked, ‘Well, mamma, ’ou (you)
can whisper it in my ear’. As this example shows, a
child in his ‘concreting’ fashion tries to get sensible
realities out of our names. A mask was called by a boy of
six a ‘grimace,’ this abstract name standing to his mind for
the grinning face. A like tendency shows itself in the
following quaint story. A boy and a girl, twins, had been
dressed alike. Later on the boy was put into a ‘suit’. A
lady asked the girl about this time whether they were not
the twins, when she replied: ‘No, we <em>used</em> to be’. ‘Twin’
was inseparably associated in her mind with the similarity
in dress. A somewhat similar effect of association of ideas
is seen in the quaint request of the little girl M. that her
mamma should ‘smell’ the pudding and make it cool.
The action of bringing the face near an object yet so as
not to touch it was associated with smelling, as in the
little girl who, according to Mr. Punch, had her sense of
propriety shocked by some irreverent person who did not
“smell his hat” when he took his seat in church. Moral
expressions get misunderstood in much the same manner.
A little girl of three and a half years, pretending that her
mother was her little girl, said: ‘You mustn’t do anything
<em>on purpose</em>’. The usual verbal context of this highly-respectable
phrase (<i>e.g.</i>, ‘You did it on purpose’) had in
the child’s mind given it a naughty meaning.</p>

<p class='c001'>With these losings of the verbal road through associative
by-paths may be taken the host of misapprehensions
into which children are apt to fall through the ambiguities
of our words and expressions, and our short and elliptical
modes of speaking. Thus an American child, noting that
children were ‘half price’ at a certain show, wanted his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>mother to get a baby now that they were cheap.<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c011'><sup>[116]</sup></a>  With
this may be compared the following: Jean Ingelow tells
us she can well remember how sad she was made by her
father telling her one day after dancing her on his knee
that he must put her down as he ‘had a bone in his leg’.<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c011'><sup>[117]</sup></a>
Much misapprehension arises, too, from our figurative use
of language, which the little listener is apt to interpret in a
very literal way. It would be worth knowing what odd
renderings the child-brain has given to such expressions as
‘an upright man,’ ‘a fish out of water,’ and the like.</p>

<p class='c001'>In addition to these comparatively passive misapprehensions
there are others which are the outcome of an intellectual
effort, the endeavour to penetrate into the mystery of some
new and puzzling words or expression. Many of us have
had our special horror, our <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>bête noire</i></span> among words, which
tormented us for months and years. I remember how
I was plagued by the word ‘wean,’ the explanation of which
was very properly, no doubt, denied me by the authorities,
and by what quaint fancies I tried to fill in a meaning.</p>

<p class='c001'>As with words, so with whole expressions and sayings.
It was a natural movement of childish thought when a little
school-girl answered the question of the Inspector, ‘What
is an average?’ by saying ‘What the hen lays eggs on’.
She had heard her mother say, “The hen lays so many eggs
‘on the average’ every week,” and had no doubt imagined
a little myth about this ‘average’. Again, most of us know
what queer renderings the child-mind has given to Scripture
language. Mr. James Payn tells us that he knew a boy
who for years substituted for the words, ‘Hallowed be thy
name,’ ‘Harold be thy name’.<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c011'><sup>[118]</sup></a>  In this and similar cases it
is not, as might be supposed, defective hearing—children
hear words as a rule with great exactness—it is the impulse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>to give a familiar and significant rendering to what is strange
and meaningless.<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c011'><sup>[119]</sup></a> A friend of mine when a boy was accustomed
on hearing the passage, ‘If I say peradventure the
darkness shall cover me,’ etc., to insert a pause after ‘peradventure,’
apprehending the passage in this wise: "If I say
‘Peradventure!’—the darkness," etc. In this way he turned
the mysterious ‘peradventure’ into a mystic ‘open sesame,’
and added a thrilling touch of magic to the passage. My
friend’s daughter tells me that on hearing the passage, “I ...
visit the sins of the fathers upon the children unto the third
and fourth generation, ... and show mercy unto thousands,”
she construed the strange word ‘generation’ to mean an immense
number like ‘billion,’ and was thus led to trouble
herself about God’s seeming to be more cruel than kind.<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c011'><sup>[120]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In some cases, too, where the language is simple enough
a child’s brain will find our meaning unsuitable and follow
a line of interpretation of its own. Mr. Canton relates that
his little heroine, who knew the lines in <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Strumpelpeter</cite></span>—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The doctor came and shook his head,</div>
      <div class='line'>And gave him nasty physic too—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>was told that she would catch a cold, and that she at once
replied, “And will the doctor come and shook my head?”<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c011'><sup>[121]</sup></a>
It was so much more natural to suppose that when the
doctor came and did something this was carried out on the
person of the patient.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is nothing more instructive in this connexion
than the talk of children among themselves about words.
They build up quaint speculations about meanings, and
try their hand bravely at definitions. Here is an example:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>A boy of five was instructing his comrade as to the puzzling
word ‘home-sick’. He did it in quite a scientific fashion.
“It’s like sea-sick, you know: you are sea-sick when you
are sick at sea, and so you’re home-sick when you’re sick
at home”.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is something of this same desire to get behind
words in children’s word-play, as we call it, their discovery
of odd affinities in verbal sounds, and their punning. Though
no doubt this contains a genuine element of childish
fun, it betokens a more serious trait also, an interest in
word-sounds as such, and a curiosity about their origin
and purpose. It is difficult for grown-up people to go
back in thought to the attitude of the child-mind towards
verbal sounds. Just as children show ‘the innocence of
the eye’ in seeing the colours of objects as they are and
not as our habits of interpretation tend to make them, so
they show an innocence of the ear, catching the intrinsic
sensuous qualities of a word or a group of words, in a way
which has become impossible for us.</p>

<p class='c001'>This half-playful, half-serious scrutiny of word-sounds
leads to the attempt to find by analysis and analogy a
familiar meaning in strange words. For example, a little
boy about four years old heard his mother speak of nurse’s
neuralgia, from which she had been suffering for some time.
He thereupon exclaimed, ‘I don’t think it’s <em>new</em> ralgia, I
call it <em>old</em> ralgia’. A child called his doll <a id='corr187.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Shakespeare’'>‘Shakespeare’</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_187.26'><ins class='correction' title='Shakespeare’'>‘Shakespeare’</ins></a></span>
because its spear-like legs could be shaken. Another boy
of three explained ‘gaiters’ as things ‘to go out of the gate
with’. Another said that the ‘Master’ which he prefixed
to his name meant that he was master of his dog. A little
girl in her third year called ‘anchovies’ <a id='corr187.31'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='‘ham-chovies,'>‘ham-chovies’</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_187.31'><ins class='correction' title='‘ham-chovies,'>‘ham-chovies’</ins></a></span>
‘mermaid’ ‘worm-maid,’ ‘whirlwind’ ‘world-wind,’ ‘gnomes’
‘no-mans’ (un-menschen), taking pleasure apparently in
bringing some familiar element—even when this seems
to other ears at least not very explanatory—into the
strange jumble of word-sound that surrounded her. A child
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>may know that he is ‘fooling’ in such cases, yet the word-play
brings a certain satisfaction, which is at least akin to
the pleasure of the older linguist.</p>

<p class='c001'>This quasi-punning transformation of words is curiously
like what may be called folk-etymology, where a foreign
word is altered by a people so as to be made to appear
significant and suitable for its purpose, as in the oft-quoted
forms ‘sparrow grass’ (asparagus) and ‘cray-fish’ (from the
French <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">écrevisse</span>, <i>cf.</i> the O. H. German Krebiz), where the
attempt to suit the form to the thing is still more apparent.<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c011'><sup>[122]</sup></a>
When, for example, a boy calls a holiday a ‘hollorday,’
because it is a day ‘to holloa in,’ we may say that he is
reflecting the process by which adults try to put meaning
into strange words, as when a cabman I overheard a few
days ago spoke about putting down <em>ash</em>phalt (for ‘asphalt’).
Some children carry out such transformation and invention
of derivation on a large scale, often resorting to pretty myths,
as when the butterflies are said to make butter, or to eat
butter, grasshoppers to give grass, honeysuckles to yield
all the honey, and so forth.<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c011'><sup>[123]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>A child will even go further, and, prying into the forms
of gender, invent explanatory myths in which words are
personified and sexualised. Thus a little boy of five years
and three months who had learned German and Italian as
well as English was much troubled about the gender of the
sun and moon. So he set about myth-making on this
wise: “I suppose people<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c011'><sup>[124]</sup></a> think the sun is the husband, the
moon is the wife, and all the stars the little children, and
Jupiter the maid”. A German girl of six was thus addressed
by her teacher: <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“‘Der’ ist männlich; Was sind
‘Die’ und ‘Das’?”</span> To which she replied prettily: <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">"Die ist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>dämlich</span> (<i>i.e.</i>, ‘ladyish’) <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">und das ist kindlich".</span> The tendency
to attribute differences of sex and age to names observable
in this last is seen in other ways. An Italian child asked
why <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">‘barba’</span> (beard) was not called ‘barbo’. With this may
be compared the pretty myth of another Italian child that
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">‘barca’</span> (boat) was the little girl of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">‘barcainolo’</span> (boatman).<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c011'><sup>[125]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>One other characteristic feature in the child’s attitude
towards words must be touched on, because it looks like the
opposite of the impulse to tamper with words just dealt
with. A child is a great stickler for accuracy in the
repetition of all familiar word-forms. The zeal of a child
in correcting others’ language, and the comical errors he
will now and again fall into in exercising his pedagogic
function, are well known to parents. Sometimes he shows
himself the most absurd of pedants. ‘Shall I read to you
out of this book, baby?’ asked a mother of her boy, about
two and a half years old. ‘No,’ replied the infant, ‘not
<em>out</em> of dot book, but somepy inside of it.’ The same little
stickler for verbal accuracy, when his nurse asked him, ‘Are
you going to build your bricks, baby?’ replied solemnly,
‘We don’t build bricks, we make them and then build <em>with</em>
them’. In the notes on the boy C. we find an example of
how jealously the child-mind insists on the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ipsissima verba</i></span>
in the recounting of his familiar stories.</p>

<p class='c001'>Are these little sticklers for verbal correctness, who object
to everything figurative in our language, who, when they
learn that a person or an animal has ‘lost his head,’ take
the expression literally, and who love nothing better than
tying us down to literal exactness, themselves given to
‘word-play’ and verbal myth-making, or have we here to
do with two varieties of childish mind? My observations
do not enable me to pronounce on this point.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have in this essay confined myself to some of the
more common and elementary features of the child’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>linguistic experience. Others present themselves when the
reading stage is reached, and the new strange stupid-looking
word-symbol on the printed page has to do duty for the
living sound, which for the child, as we have seen, seems to
belong to the object and to share in its life. But this subject,
tempting as it is, must be left. And the same must be
said of those special difficulties and problems which arise
for the child-mind when two or more languages are spoken.
This is a branch of child-linguistics which, so far as I know,
has never been explored.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>VI. <br /> SUBJECT TO FEAR.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c017'><i>Children’s Sensibility.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>In passing from a study of children’s ideas to an investigation
of their feelings, we seem to encounter quite another
kind of problem. A child has the germs of ideas long
before he can give them clear articulate expression; and,
as we have seen, he has at first to tax his ingenuity in
order to convey by intelligible signs the thoughts which
arise in his mind. For the manifestation of his feelings of
pleasure and pain, on the other hand, nature has endowed
him with adequate expression. The states of infantile
discontent and content, misery and gladness, pronounce
themselves with a clearness and an emphasis which leave
no room for misunderstanding.</p>

<p class='c001'>This full frank manifestation of feeling holds good
more especially of those states of bodily comfort and discomfort
which make up the first rude experiences of life.
It is necessary for the child’s preservation that he should
be able to announce by clear signals the oncoming of his
cravings and of his sufferings, and we all know how well
nature has provided for this necessity. Hence the fulness
with which infant psychology has dealt with this first
chapter of the life of feeling. Preyer, for example, gives
a full and almost exhaustive epitome of the various shades
of infantile pleasure and pain which grow out of this life
of sense and appetite, and has carefully described their
physiological accompaniments and their signatures.<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c011'><sup>[126]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>When we pass from these elementary forms of pleasure
and pain to the rudiments of emotion proper, as the
miseries of fear, the sorrows and joys of the affections,
we have still, no doubt, to do with a mode of manifestation
which, on the whole, is direct and unreserved to a gratifying
extent. A child of three is delightfully incapable of the
skilful repressions, and the yet more skilful simulations
of emotion which are easy to the adult.<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c011'><sup>[127]</sup></a> Yet frank and
transparent as is the first instinctive utterance of feeling,
it is apt to get checked at an early date, giving place
to a certain reserve. So that, as we know from published
reminiscences of childhood, a child of six will have learnt
to hide some of his deepest feelings from unsympathetic
eyes.</p>

<p class='c001'>This shyness of the young heart, face to face with old
and strange ways of feeling, exposed to ridicule if not to
something worse, makes the problem of registering the
pulsations of its emotions more difficult than it at first seems.
As a matter of fact we are still far from knowing the precise
range and depth of children’s feelings. This is seen plainly
enough in the quite opposite views which are entertained of
childish sensibility, some describing it as restricted and
obtuse, others as morbidly excessive. Such diversity of
view may no doubt arise from differences in the fields of
observation, since, as we know, children differ hardly less
than adults perhaps in breadth and fineness of emotional
susceptibility. Yet I think that this contrariety of view
points further to the conclusion that we are still far from
sounding with finely measuring scientific apparatus the
currents of childish emotion.</p>

<p class='c001'>It seems, then, to be worth while to look further into
the matter in the hope of gaining a deeper and fuller insight,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>and as a step in this direction I propose to inquire into
the various forms and the causes of one of the best
marked and most characteristic of children’s feelings—namely,
fear.</p>

<p class='c001'>That fear is one of the characteristic feelings of the
child needs no proving. It seems to belong to these wee,
weakly things, brought face to face with a new strange
world, to tremble. They are naturally timid, as all that is
weak and ignorant in nature is apt to be timid.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have said that fear is well marked in the child. Yet,
though it is true that fully developed fear or terror shows
itself by unmistakable signs, there are many cases where
it is difficult to say whether the child is the subject of this
feeling. Thus it is doubtful whether the tremblings and
disturbances of respiration which are said to betray fear in
the new-born infant are a full expression of this state.<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c011'><sup>[128]</sup></a>
Again, the reflex movement of a start on hearing a sound
hardly amounts to the full reaction of fear, though it is akin
to it.<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c011'><sup>[129]</sup></a> A child may, further, show a sort of æsthetic dislike
for an ugly form or sound, turning away in evident aversion,
and yet not be afraid in the full sense. Fear proper betrays
itself in the stare, the grave look, and in such movements
as turning away and hiding the face against the nurse’s or
mother’s shoulder, and sometimes in covering it with the
hands. In severer forms it leads to trembling and to wild
shrieking. Changes of colour also occur. It is commonly
said that great fear produces paleness; but according to one
of my correspondents who has had considerable experience,
a child may show the feeling by his face turning scarlet.
Fear, if not very intense, leads to voluntary movements, as
turning away, putting the object aside, or moving away. In
its more violent forms, however, it paralyses the child. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>is desirable that parents should carefully observe and
describe the first signs of fear in their children.<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c011'><sup>[130]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'><i>Startling Effect of Sounds.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>It may be well to begin our study of fear by a reference
to the effect of startling. As is well known, sudden and
loud sounds, as that of a door banging, will give a shock
to an infant in the first weeks of life, which though not
amounting to fear is its progenitor. A clearer manifestation
occurs when a new and unfamiliar sound calls forth
the grave look, the trembling lip, and possibly the fit of
crying. Darwin gives an excellent example of this. He
had, he tells us, been accustomed to make all sorts of
sudden noises with his boy, aged four and a half months,
which were well received; but one day having introduced a
new sound, that of a loud snoring, he found that the child
was quite upset, bursting out into a fit of crying.<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c011'><sup>[131]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>As this incident suggests, it is not every new sound
which is thus disconcerting to the little stranger. Sudden
sharp sounds of any kind seem to be especially disliked, as
those of a dog’s bark. The child M. burst out crying on
first hearing the sound of a baby rattle; and she did the
same two months later on accidentally ringing a hand bell.
Louder and more voluminous sounds, too, are apt to have
an alarming effect. The big noise of a factory, of a steam-ship,
of a passing train, are among the sounds assigned by
my correspondents as causes of this early startling and
upsetting effect. A little girl when taken into the country
at the age of nine months, though she liked the animals
she saw on the whole, showed fear by seeking shelter against
the nurse’s shoulder, on hearing the bleating of the sheep.
So strong is this effect of suddenness and volume of sound
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>that even musical sounds often excite some alarm at first.
‘He (a boy of four months) cried when he first heard the
piano,’ writes one lady, and this is but a sample of many
observations. A child of five and a half months showed
such a horror of a banjo that he would scream if it
were played or only touched. Preyer’s boy at sixteen
months was apparently alarmed when his father, in order to
entertain him, produced what seems to us a particularly
pure musical tone by rubbing a drinking-glass. He remarks
that this same sound had been produced when the child
was four months old without any ill effects.<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c011'><sup>[132]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This last fact suggests that such shrinkings from sound
may be developed at a comparatively late date. This idea
is supported by other observations. “From about two
years four months (writes a mother) to the present time
(two years eleven months), he has shown signs of fear of
music. At two years five months he liked some singing of
rounds, but when a fresh person with a stronger voice than
the rest joined, he begged the singer to stop. Presently he
tolerated the singing as long as he might stand at the
farthest corner of the room.” This child was also about
the same time afraid of the piano, and of the organ, when
played by his mother in a church.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is worth noting that animals show a similar dread of
musical sounds. I took a young cat of about eight weeks
in my lap and struck some chords not loudly on the piano.
It got up, moved uneasily from side to side, then bolted
to the corner of the room and seemed to try to get up the
walls. Dogs, too, certainly seem to be put out, if not to
experience fear, at the music of a brass band.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is sometimes supposed that this startling effect of
loud sounds is wholly an affair of nervous disturbance:<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c011'><sup>[133]</sup></a>
but the late development of the repugnance in certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>cases seems to show that this is not the only cause at work.
Of course a child’s nervous organisation may through ill
health become more sensitive to this disturbing effect; and,
as the life of Chopin tells us, the delicate organisation of
a future musician may be specially subject to these shocks.
Yet I suspect that vague alarm at the unexpected and unknown
takes part here. There is something uncanny to
the child in the very production of sound from a silent
thing. A banjo lying now inert, harmless, and then
suddenly firing off a whole gamut of sound may well
shock a small child’s preconceptions of things. The second
time that fear was observed in one child at the age of ten
months, it was excited by a new toy which squeaked on
being pressed.<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c011'><sup>[134]</sup></a> This seems to be another example of the
disconcerting effect of the unexpected. In other cases the
alarming effect of the mystery is increased by the absence
of all visible cause. One little boy of two years used to
get sadly frightened at the sound of the water rushing into
the cistern which was near his nursery. The child was
afraid at the same time of thunder, calling it ‘water
coming’.</p>

<p class='c001'>I am far from saying that all children manifest this
fear of sounds. Miss Shinn points out that her niece was
from the first pleased with the piano, and this is no doubt true
of many children. Children behave very differently towards
thunder, some being greatly disturbed by it, others being
rather delighted. Thus Preyer’s boy, who was so ignominiously
upset by the tone of the drinking-glass, laughed
at the thunderstorm; and we know that the little Walter
Scott was once found during a thunderstorm lying on his
back in the open air clapping his hands and shouting
“Bonnie, bonnie!” at the flashes of lightning. It is possible
that in such cases the exhilarating effect of the brightness
counteracts the uncanny effect of the thunder. More
observations are needed on this point.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>A complete explanation of these early vague alarms of
the ear may as yet not be possible. Children show in the
matter of sound capricious repugnances which it is exceedingly
difficult to account for. They seem sometimes
to have their pet aversions like older folk. Yet I think
that a general explanation is possible.</p>

<p class='c001'>To begin with, then, it is probable that in many of
these cases, especially those occurring in the first six
months, we have to do with an organic phenomenon, with
a sort of jar to the nervous system. To understand this
we have to remember that the ear, in the case of man at
least, is the sense-organ through which the nervous system is
most powerfully and profoundly acted on. Sounds seem
to go through us, to pierce us, to shake us, to pound and
crush us. A child of four or six months has a nervous
organisation still weak and unstable, and we should
naturally expect loud sounds to produce a disturbing
effect on it.</p>

<p class='c001'>To this it is to be added that sounds have a way of
taking us by surprise, of seeming to start out of nothing;
and this aspect of them, as I have pointed out above, may
well excite vague alarm in the small creatures to whom all
that is new and unlooked for is apt to seem uncanny.
The fact that most children soon lose their fear by getting
used to the sounds seems to show how much the new and
the mysterious has to do with the effect.</p>

<p class='c001'>Whether heredity plays any part here, <i>e.g.</i>, in the fear of
the dog’s barking and other sounds of animals, seems to
me exceedingly doubtful. This point will, however, come
up for closer consideration presently, when we deal with
children’s fear of animals.</p>

<p class='c001'>Before considering the manifold outgoings of fear produced
by impressions of the eye, we may glance at another
form of early disturbance which has some analogy to the
shock-like effects of certain sounds. I refer here to the
feeling of bodily insecurity which appears very early when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>the child is awkwardly carried, or let down back-foremost,
and later when he begins to walk. One child in her fifth
month was observed when carried to hold on to the nurse’s
dress as if for safety. And it has been noticed by more
than one observer that on dandling a baby up and down
in one’s arms, it will on descending, that is when the support
of the arms is being withdrawn, show signs of discontent
in struggling movements.<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c011'><sup>[135]</sup></a> Bell, Preyer, and others
regard this as an instinctive form of fear. Such manifestations
may, however, be merely the result of sudden and
rude disturbances of the sense of bodily ease which attends
the habitual condition of adequate support. A child accustomed
to lie in a cradle, on the floor, or on somebody’s
lap, might be expected to be put out when the supporting
mass is greatly reduced, as in bad carrying, or wholly
removed, as in quickly lowering him backwards. The
fear of falling, which shows itself during the first attempts
to stand, comes, it must be remembered, as an accompaniment
of a new and highly strange situation. The first
experience of using the legs for support must, one supposes,
involve a profound change in the child’s whole bodily
consciousness, a change which may well be accompanied
with a sense of disturbance. Not only so, it comes after
a considerable experience of partial fallings, as in trying
to turn over when lying, half climbing the sides of the
cradle, etc., and still harder bumpings when the crawling
stage is reached. These would, I suspect, be quite sufficient
to produce the timidity which is observable on
making the bolder venture of standing.<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c011'><sup>[136]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'><i>Fear of Visible Things.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Fears excited by visual impressions come later than
those excited by sounds. The reason of this seems pretty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>obvious. Visual sensations do not produce the strong
effect of nervous shock which auditory ones produce. Let
a person compare the violent and profound jar which he
experiences on suddenly hearing a loud sound, with the
slight surface-agitation produced by the sudden movement
of an object across the field of vision. The latter has less
of the effect of nervous jar and more of the characteristics
of fear proper, that is, apprehension of evil. We should
accordingly expect that eye-fears would only begin to
show themselves in the child after experience had begun
its educative work.<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c011'><sup>[137]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>At the outset it is well, as in the case of the ear-fears,
to keep before us the distinction between a mere dislike to
a sensation and a true reaction of fear. We shall find that
children’s quasi-æsthetic dislikes to certain colours may
readily simulate the appearance of fears.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among the earliest manifestations of fear excited by
visual impressions we have those called forth by the presentation
of something new and strange, especially when
it involves a rupture of customary arrangements. Although
children love and delight in what is new, their disposition
to fear is apt to give to new and strange objects a disquieting,
if not distinctly alarming character. This apprehension
shows itself as soon as a child has begun to be used or
accustomed to a particular state of things.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among the more disconcerting effects of a rude
departure from the customary, we have that of change of
place. At first the infant betrays no sign of disturbance
on being carried into a new room. But when once it has
grown accustomed to a certain room it will feel a new one to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>be strange, and eye its features with a perceptibly anxious
look. This sense of strangeness in place sometimes
appears very early. The little girl M., on being taken at
the age of four months into a new nursery, “looked all round
and then burst out crying”. This feeling of uneasiness
may linger late. A boy retained up to the age of three
years eight months the fear of being left alone in strange
hotels or lodgings. Yet entrance on a new abode does
not by any means always excite this reaction. A child
may have his curiosity excited, or may be amused by the
odd look of things. Thus one boy on being taken at the
age of fifteen months to a fresh house and given a small
plain room looked round and laughed at the odd carpet.
Children even of the same age appear in such circumstances
to vary greatly with respect to the relative strength of the
impulses of fear and curiosity.</p>

<p class='c001'>How different children’s mental attitude may be towards
the new and unfamiliar is illustrated by some notes on a
boy sent me by his mother. This child, “though hardly
ever afraid of strange people or places, was very much
frightened as a baby <em>of familiar things seen after an interval</em>”.
Thus “at ten months he was excessively frightened
on returning to his nursery after a month’s absence. On
this occasion he screamed violently if his nurse left his side
for a moment for some hours after he got home, whereas
he had not in the least objected to being installed in a
strange nursery.” The mother adds that “at thirteen
months, his memory having grown stronger, he was very
much pleased at coming to his home after being away a
fortnight”. This case looks puzzling enough at first, and
seems to contradict the laws of infant psychology. Perhaps
the child’s partial recognition was accompanied by a
sense of the uncanny, like that which we experience when
a place seems familiar to us though we have no clear
recollection of having seen it before.</p>

<p class='c001'>What applies to places applies also to persons: a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>sudden change of customary human surroundings by the
arrival of a stranger on the scene is apt to trouble the
child.</p>

<p class='c001'>At first all faces seem alike for the child. Later on
unfamiliar faces excite something like a grave inquisitorial
scrutiny. Yet, for the first three months, there is no
distinct manifestation of a fear of strangers. It is only later,
when attachment to human belongings has been developed,
that the approach of a stranger, especially if accompanied
by a proposal to take the child, calls forth clear signs of
displeasure and the shrinking away of fear. Preyer gives
the sixth and seventh months as the date at which his boy
began to cry at the sight of a strange face. In one set of
notes sent me it was remarked that a child of four and a
half months would cry on being nursed by a stranger.
To be nursed by a stranger, however, is to have the
whole baby-world revolutionised; little wonder then
that it should bring the feeling of strangeness and homelessness.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here, too, curious differences soon begin to disclose
themselves, some children being decidedly more sociable
towards strangers than others. It would be curious to
compare the age at which children begin to take kindly
to them. Preyer gives nineteen months as the date at
which his boy surmounted his timidity; but it is probable
that the transition occurs at very different dates in the
case of different children.<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c011'><sup>[138]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It is worth noting that the little boy to whom I referred
just now displayed the same signs of uneasiness at
seeing old friends, after an interval, as at returning to old
scenes. When eight months old, “he moaned in a curious
way when his nurse (of whom he was very fond) came
home after a fortnight’s holiday”. Here, however, the
signs of fear seem to be less pronounced than in the case
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>of returning to the old room. It would be difficult to give
the right name to this curious moan.</p>

<p class='c001'>Partial alteration of the surroundings frequently brings
about a measure of this same mental uneasiness. Preyer’s
boy when one year and five months old was much disturbed
at seeing his mother in a black dress. Children seem
to have a special dislike to black apparel. George Sand
describes her fear at having to put on black stockings when
her father died. Yet any change of colour in dress will
disturb a child. C., when an infant, was distressed to tears
at the spectacle of a new colour and pattern on his mother’s
dress. This dislike to any change of dress as such is borne
out by other observations. A child manifested between the
age of about seven months and of two and a half years
the most marked repugnance to new clothes, so that the
authorities found it very difficult to get them on. It is
presumable that the donning of new apparel disturbed too
rudely the child’s sense of his proper self.</p>

<p class='c001'>In certain cases the introduction of new natural objects
of great extent and impressiveness will produce a similar
effect of childish anxiety, as though they made too violent
a change in the surroundings. One of the best illustrations
of this obtainable from the life of an average well-to-do
child is the impression produced by a first visit to the sea.
Preyer’s boy at the age of twenty-one months showed all
the signs of fear when his nurse carried him on her arm
close to the sea.<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c011'><sup>[139]</sup></a> The boy C. on being first taken near the
sea at the age of two was disturbed by its noise. While,
however, I have a number of well-authenticated cases of
such an instinctive repugnance to, and something like dread
of the sea, I find that there is by no means uniformity in
children’s behaviour in this particular. A little boy who
first saw the sea at the age of thirteen months exhibited
signs not of fear but of wondering delight, prettily stretching
out his tiny hands towards it as if wanting to go to it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>Another child who also first saw the sea at the age of
thirteen months began to crawl towards the waves. And
yet another boy at the age of twenty-one months on first
seeing the sea spread his arms as if to embrace it.</p>

<p class='c001'>These observations show that the strange big thing
affects children very differently. C. had a particular dislike
to noises, which was, I think, early strengthened by finding
out that his father had the same prejudice. Hence perhaps
his hostile attitude towards the sea.</p>

<p class='c001'>Probably, too, imaginative children, whose minds take
in something of the bigness of the sea, will be more disposed
to this variety of fear. A mother writes me that her elder
child, an imaginative girl, has not even now at the age of
six got over her fear of going into the sea, whereas her
sister, one and a quarter years younger, and not of an
imaginative temperament, is perfectly fearless. She adds
that it is the bigness of the sea which evidently impresses
the imagination of the elder.</p>

<p class='c001'>Imaginative children, too, are apt to give life and purpose
to the big moving noisy thing. This is illustrated in
M. Pierre Loti’s graphic account of his first childish impressions
of the sea, seen one evening in the twilight. “It
was of a dark, almost black green: it seemed restless,
treacherous, ready to swallow: it was stirring and swaying
everywhere at the same time, with the look of sinister
wickedness.”<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c011'><sup>[140]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>There seems enough in the vast waste of unresting
waters to excite the imagination of a child to awe and
terror. Hence it is needless to follow M. Loti in his
speculations as to an inherited fear of the sea. He seems
to base this supposition on the fact that at this first view he
distinctly <em>recognised</em> the sea. But such recognition may
have meant merely the objective realisation of what had no
doubt been before pretty fully described by his mother and
aunt, and imaginatively pictured by himself.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>The opposite attitude, that of the thoroughly unimaginative
child, in presence of the sea is well illustrated by the
story of a little girl aged two, who, on being first taken to
see the watery wonder, exclaimed, “Oh, mamma, look at the
soapy water”. The awful mystery of all the stretch of
ever-moving water was invisible to this child, being hidden
behind the familiar detail of the ‘soapy’ edge.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is probably nothing in the natural world which
makes on the childish imagination quite so awful an impression
as the watery Leviathan. Perhaps the fear which
one of my correspondents tells me was excited in her when
a child by the sudden appearance of a mountain may be
akin to this dread of the sea.</p>

<p class='c001'>We may now pass to another group of fear-excitants,
the appearance of certain strange forms and movements of
objects.</p>

<p class='c001'>The close connexion between æsthetic dislike and fear
is seen in the well-marked recoilings of children from odd
uncanny-looking dolls. The girl M., when just over six
months old, was frightened at a Japanese doll so that it
had to be put in another room. Another child when
thirteen months old was terrified at the sight of an
ugly doll. The said doll is described as black with
woolly head, startled eyes, and red lips. Such an ogre
might well call up a tremor in the bravest of children.
In another case, that of a little boy of two years and two
months, the broken face of a doll proved to be highly disconcerting.
The mother describes the effect as mixed of
fear, distress, and intellectual wonder. Nor did his anxiety
depart when some hours later the doll, after sleeping in
his mother’s room, reappeared with a new face.</p>

<p class='c001'>In such cases, it seems plain, it is the ugly transformation
of something specially familiar and agreeable which
excites the feeling of nervous apprehension. Making
grimaces, that is the spoiling of the typical familiar face,
may, it is said, disturb a child even at the early age of two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>months.<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c011'><sup>[141]</sup></a> It is much the same when the child M., at the
age of thirteen months three weeks, was frightened and
howled when a lady looked at her close with blue spectacles,
though she was quite used to ordinary glasses. Such transformations
of the homely and assuring face are, moreover,
not only ugly but bewildering to the child, and where all is
mysterious and uncanny the child is apt to fear. Whether
“inherited associations” involving a dim recognition of the
<em>meaning</em> of these distortions play any part here I do not
feel at all certain.</p>

<p class='c001'>Children, like animals, will sometimes show fear at the
sight of what seems to us a quite harmless object. A shying
horse is a puzzle to his rider: his terrors are so unpredictable.
Similarly in the case of a timid child almost anything
unfamiliar and out of the way, whether in the colour,
the form, or the movement of an object, may provoke a
measure of anxiety. Thus a little girl, aged one year and
ten months, showed signs of fear during a drive at a row of
grey ash trees placed along the road. This was just the
kind of thing that a horse might shy at.</p>

<p class='c001'>As with animals, so with children, any seemingly
uncaused movement is apt to excite a feeling of alarm.
Just as a dog will run away from a leaf whirled about by the
wind, so children are apt to be terrified by the strange and
quite irregular behaviour of a feather as it glides along the
floor or lifts itself into the air. A little girl of three, standing
by the bedside of her mother (who was ill at the time),
was so frightened at the sight of a feather, which she accidentally
pulled out of the eiderdown quilt, floating in the air
that she would not approach the bed for days afterwards.<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c011'><sup>[142]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In these cases we may suppose that we have to do with
a germ of superstitious fear, which seems commonly to have
its starting point in the appearance of something exceptional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>and uncanny, that is to say, unintelligible, and so
smacking of the supernatural. The fear of feathers as
uncanny objects plays, I am told, a considerable part in
the superstitions of folk-lore. Such apparently self-caused
movements, so suggestive of life, might easily give rise to
a vague sense of a mysterious presence or power possessing
the object, and so lead to a crude form of a belief in
supernatural agents.</p>

<p class='c001'>In other cases of unexpected and mysterious movement
the fear is slightly different. A little boy when one year and
eleven months old was frightened when in a lady’s house by a
toy elephant which shook its head. The same child, writes
his mother, “at one year seven months was very much
scared by a toy cow which mooed realistically when its
head was moved. This cow was subsequently given to
him, at about two years and three months. He was then
still afraid of it, but became reconciled soon after, first
allowing others to make it moo if he was at a safe distance,
and at last making it moo himself.”</p>

<p class='c001'>There may have been a germ of the fear of animals here:
but I suspect that it was mainly a feeling of uneasiness at
the signs of life (movement and sound) appearing when they
are not expected, and have an uncanny aspect. The close
simulation of a living thing by what is known to be not
alive is disturbing to the child as to the adult. He will
make his toys alive by his own fancy, yet resent their taking
on the full semblance of reality. In this sense he is a born
idealist and not a realist. More careful observations on
this curious group of child-fears are to be desired.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fear of shadows is closely related to that of moving
toys. They are semblances, though horribly distorted
semblances, and they are apt to move with an awful rapidity.
The unearthly mounting shadows which accompany the
child as he climbs the staircase at night have been instanced
by writers as one of childhood’s freezing horrors.
Mr. Stevenson writes:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>Now my little heart goes beating like a drum,</div>
      <div class='line'>With the breath of the Bogie in my hair;</div>
      <div class='line'>And all round the candle the crooked shadows come,</div>
      <div class='line'>And go marching along up the stair;</div>
      <div class='line'>The shadow of the balusters, the shadow of the lamp,</div>
      <div class='line'>The shadow of the child that goes to bed—</div>
      <div class='line'>All the wicked shadows coming tramp, tramp, tramp,</div>
      <div class='line'>With the black night overhead.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>I have noticed a young cat—the same that showed such
terror at the playing of the piano—watch its own shadow
rising on the wall, and, as I thought, with a look of apprehension.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><cite>The Fear of Animals.</cite></h3>

<p class='c014'>I have purposely reserved for special discussion two
varieties of children’s fear, namely, dread of animals and
of the dark. As the former certainly manifests itself before
the latter I will take it first.</p>

<p class='c001'>It seems odd that the creatures which are to become
the companions and playmates of children, and one of the
chief sources of their happiness, should cause so much alarm
when they first come on the scene. Yet so it is. Many
children, at least, are at first put out by quite harmless
members of the animal family. We must, however, be
careful here in distinguishing between mere nerve-shock
and dislike on the one hand and genuine fear on the other.
Thus a lady whom I know, a good observer, tells me
that her boy, though when he was fifteen months old his
nerves were shaken by the loud barking of a dog, had no
real fear of dogs. With this may be contrasted another case,
also sent by a good observer, in which it is specially noted
that the aversion to the sound of a dog’s barking developed
late and was a true fear.</p>

<p class='c001'>Æsthetic dislikes, again, may easily give rise to quasi-fears,
though, as we all know, little children have not the
horrors of their elders in this respect. The boy C. could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>not understand his mother’s scare at the descending caterpillar.
A kind of æsthetic dislike appears to show itself
sometimes towards animals of peculiar shape and colour.
A black animal, as a sheep or a cow, seems more particularly
to come in for these childish aversions.</p>

<p class='c001'>At first it seems impossible to understand why a
child in the fourteenth week should shrink from a cat.<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c011'><sup>[143]</sup></a>
This is not, so far as I can gather, a common occurrence at
this age, and one would like to cross-examine the mother
on the precise way in which the child had its first introduction
to the domestic pet. So far as one can speculate
on the matter, one would say that such early shrinking
from animals is probably due to their sudden unexpected
movements, which may well disconcert the inexperienced
infant accustomed to comparatively restful surroundings.</p>

<p class='c001'>This seems borne out by another instance, also quoted
by Preyer, of a girl who in the fourth month, as also in
the eleventh, was so afraid of pigeons that she could not
bring herself to stroke them. The prettiness of the pigeon,
if not of the cat, ought, one supposes, to ensure the liking of
children; and one has to fall back on the supposition of
the first disconcerting strangeness of the moving animal
world for the child’s mind.</p>

<p class='c001'>Later shrinkings from animals show more of the nature
of fear. It is sometimes said that children inherit from
their ancestors the fear of certain animals. Thus Darwin,
observing that his boy when taken to the Zoological
Gardens at the age of two years and three months showed
fear of the big caged animals whose form was unfamiliar
to him (lions, tigers, etc.), infers that this fear is transmitted
from savage ancestors whose conditions of life compelled
them to shun these deadly creatures. But as M. Compayré
has well shown<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c011'><sup>[144]</sup></a> we do not need this hypothesis here. The
unfamiliarity of the form of the animal, its bigness, together
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>with the awful suggestions of the cage, would be quite
enough to beget a vague sense of danger.</p>

<p class='c001'>So far as I can ascertain facts are strongly opposed to
the theory of an inherited fear of animals. Just as in the first
months a child will manifest something like recoil from a
pretty and perfectly innocent pigeon, so later on children
manifest fear in the most unlikely directions. In <cite>The
Invisible Playmate</cite>, we are told of a girl who got her first
fright on seeing a sparrow drop on the grass near her,
though she was not the least afraid of big things, and on
first hearing the dog bark in his kennel said with a little
laugh of surprise, ‘Oh! coughing’.<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c011'><sup>[145]</sup></a> A parallel case is
sent me by a lady friend. One day when her daughter
was about four years old she found her standing, the eyes
wide open and filled with tears, the arms outstretched for
help, evidently transfixed with terror, while a small wood-louse
made its slow way towards her. The next day the
child was taken for the first time to the “Zoo,” and the
mother anticipating trouble held the child’s hand. But
there was no need. A ‘fearless spirit’ in general, she
released her hand at the first sight of the elephant, and
galloped after the monster. If inheritance played a principal
part in the child’s fear of animals one would have
expected the facts to be reversed: the elephant should
have excited dread, not the harmless insect.</p>

<p class='c001'>So far as my own observations have gone there seems
to be but little uniformity among children’s fears of the
animal world. What frightens one child may delight
another at about the same age. Perhaps there is a tendency
to a special dread of certain animals, more particularly the
wolf, which as folk-lore tells us reflects the attitude of
superstitious adults. Yet it is probable that, as the case of
the boy C. suggests, the dread of the wolf grows out of
that of the dog, the most alarming of the domestic animals,
while it is vigorously sustained by fairy-story.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>For the rest children’s shrinking from animals has
much of the caprice of grown-up people’s. Not that there
is anything really inexplicable in these odd directions of
childish fear, any more than in the unpredictable shyings of
the <a id='corr210.5'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='horse'>horse.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_210.5'><ins class='correction' title='horse'>horse.</ins></a></span> If we knew the whole of the horse’s history,
and could keep a perfect register of the fluctuations of ‘tone’
in his nervous system, we should understand all his shyings.
So with the child. All the vagaries of his dislike to animals
would be cleared up if we could look into the secret workings
of his mind and measure the varying heights of his
courage.</p>

<p class='c001'>That some of this early disquietude at the sight of
strange animals is due to the workings of the mind is seen
in the behaviour of Preyer’s boy when at the age of twenty-seven
months he was taken to see some little pigs. The
boy at the first sight looked earnest, and as soon as the
lively little creatures began to suckle the mother he broke
out into a fit of crying and turned away from the sight
with all the signs of fear. It appeared afterwards that what
terrified the child was the idea that the pigs were biting
their mother; and this gave rise in the fourth and fifth years
to recurrent nocturnal fears of the biting piglets, something
like C.’s nocturnal fear of the wolf.<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c011'><sup>[146]</sup></a> To an imaginative
child strongly predisposed to fear, anything suggestive of
harm will suffice to beget a measure of trepidation. A
child does not want direct experience of the power of a big
animal in order to feel a vague uneasiness when near it.
His own early inductions respecting the correlation of
bigness with strength, aided as this commonly is by information
picked up from others, will amply suffice. In the
case of the dog, the rough shaggy coat, the teeth which he
is told can bite, the swift movements, and worse than all
the appalling bark, are quite enough to disconcert a timid
child. Even the sudden pouncing down of a sparrow may
prove upsetting to a fearful mite as suggesting attack; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>a girl of four may be quite capable of imagining the unpleasantness
of an invasion of her dainty person by a small
creeping wood-louse—which though running slowly was
running towards herself—and so of getting a fit of
shudders.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is, I think, undeniable that imaginative children,
especially when sickly and disposed to alarm, are subject
to a real terror at the thought of the animal world. Its
very vastness, the large variety of its uncanny and savage-looking
forms—appearing oftentimes as ugly distortions of
the human face and figure—this of itself, as known from
picture-books, may well generate many a vague alarm.
We know from folk-lore how the dangers of the animal
world have touched the imagination of simple peoples,
and we need not be surprised that it should make the heart
of the wee weakly child to quake. Yet the child’s
shrinking from animals is less strong than the impulse of
companionship which bears him towards them. Tiny children
quite as often show the impulse to run after ducks
and other animals as to be alarmed at them. Nothing
perhaps is prettier in child-life than the pose and look of
one of these defenceless youngsters as he is getting over
his trepidation at the approach of a strange big dog and
‘making friends’ with the shaggy monster. The perfect
love which lies at the bottom of children’s hearts towards
their animal kinsfolk soon casts out fear. And when once
the reconciliation has been effected it will take a good deal
of harsh experience to make the child ever again entertain
the thought of danger.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><i>Fear of the Dark.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Fear of the dark, that is, fear excited by the actual
experience or the idea of being in the dark, and especially
<em>alone</em> in the dark, and the allied dread of dark places as
closets and caves, is no doubt very common among children,
and seems indeed to be one of their recognised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>characteristics. Yet it is by no means certain that it is
‘natural’ in the sense of developing itself in all children.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is certain that children have no such fear at the
beginning of life. A baby of three or four months if accustomed
to a light may very likely be disturbed at being
deprived of it; but this is some way from a dread of the
dark.<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c011'><sup>[147]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Fear of the dark seems to arise when intelligence
has reached a certain stage of development. It apparently
assumes a variety of forms. In some children it is a vague
uneasiness, in others it takes the shape of a more definite
dread. A common variety of this dread is connected with
the imaginative filling of the dark with the forms of
alarming animals, so that the fear of animals and of the
dark are closely connected. Thus, in one case reported to
me, a boy between the ages of two and six used at night to
see ‘the eyes of lions and tigers glaring as they walked
round the room’. The boy C. saw his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>bête noire</i></span> the wolf
in dark places. Mr. Stevens in his note on his boy’s idea
of the supernatural remarks that at the age of one year and
ten months, when he began to be haunted by the spectre
of ‘Cocky,’ he was temporarily seized with a fear of the
dark.<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c011'><sup>[148]</sup></a> It is important to add that even children who have
been habituated to going to bed in the dark in the first
months are liable to acquire the fear.</p>

<p class='c001'>This mode of fear is, however, not universal among
children. One lady, for whose accuracy I can vouch,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>assures me that her boy, who is now four years old,
has never manifested the feeling. A similar statement
is made by a careful observer, Dr. Sikorski, with reference
to his own children.<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c011'><sup>[149]</sup></a> It seems possible to go through
childhood without making acquaintance with this terror,
and to acquire it in later life. I know a lady who only
acquired the fear towards the age of thirty. “Curiously
enough (she writes) I was never afraid of the dark as a
child; but during the last two years I hate to be left alone
in the dark, and if I have to enter a dark room, like my
study, beyond the reach of the maids from downstairs, I
notice a remarkable acceleration in my heart-beat and
hurry to strike a light or rush downstairs as quickly as
possible.”</p>

<p class='c001'>We can faintly conjecture from what Charles Lamb and
others have told us about the spectres that haunted their
nights what a weighty crushing horror this fear of the dark
may become. Hence we need not be surprised that the
writer of fiction has sought to give it a vivid and adequate
description. Victor Hugo, for example, when in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Les
Misérables</cite></span> he is painting the feelings of little Cosette, who
has been sent out alone at night to fetch water from a
spring in a wood, says she “felt herself seized by the
black enormity of Nature. It was not only terror which
possessed her, it was something more terrible even than
terror.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Different explanations have been offered of this fear.
Locke, who when writing on educational matters was rather
hard on nurses and servants, puts down the whole of
these fears to those wicked persons, “whose usual method
is to awe children and keep them in subjection by telling
them of Raw Head and Bloody Bones, and such other
names as carry with them the idea of something terrible
and hurtful, which they have reason to be afraid of when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>alone, especially in the dark”.<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c011'><sup>[150]</sup></a>  Rousseau on the other
hand urges that there is a natural cause. “Accustomed as
I am to perceive objects from a distance, and to anticipate
their impressions in advance, how is it possible for me,
when I no longer see anything of the objects that surround
me, not to imagine a thousand creatures, a thousand
movements, which may hurt me, and against which I am
unable to protect myself?”<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c011'><sup>[151]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Rousseau here supplements and corrects Locke. For
one thing I have ascertained in the case of my own child,
and in that of others, that a fear of the dark has grown up
when the influence of the wicked nurse has been carefully
eliminated. Locke forgets that children can get terrifying
fancies from other children, and from all sorts of suggestions,
unwittingly conveyed by the words of respectable
grown people. Besides, he leaves untouched the question,
why children when left alone in the dark should choose
to dwell on these fearful images, rather than on the bright
pretty ones which they also acquire. R. L. Stevenson
has told us how happy a child can make himself at night
with such pleasing fancies. Yet it must be owned that
darkness seems rather to favour images of what is weird
and terrible. How is this? Rousseau gets some way towards
answering the question by saying (as I understand
him to say) that darkness breeds a sense of insecurity.
I do not, however, think that it is the inconvenience of
being in the dark which generates the fear: a child might,
I imagine, acquire it without ever having had to explore a
dark place.</p>

<p class='c001'>I strongly suspect that the fear of darkness takes its
rise in a sensuous phenomenon, a kind of physical repugnance.
All sensations of very low intensity, as very soft
vocal sounds, have about them a tinge of melancholy,
a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>tristesse</i></span>, and this is especially noticeable in the sensations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>which the eye experiences when confronted with a dark
space, or, what is tantamount to this, a black and dull
surface. The symbolism of darkness and blackness, as
when we talk of ‘gloomy’ thoughts or liken trouble to a
‘black cloud,’ seems to rest on this effect of melancholy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Along with this gloomy character of the sensation of
dark, and not always easy to distinguish from it, there goes
the craving of the eye for its customary light, and the
interest and the gladness which come with seeing. When
the eye and brain are not fatigued, that is when we are
wakeful, this eye-ache may become an appreciable pain;
and it is probable that children feel the deprivation more
acutely than grown persons, owing to the abundance of
their visual activity as well as to the comparatively scanty
store of their thought-resources. Add to this that darkness,
by extinguishing the world of visible things, would give to
a timid child tenacious of the familiar home-surroundings
a peculiarly keen sense of strangeness and of loneliness, of
banishment from all that he knows and loves. The reminiscences
of this feeling described in later life show that
it is the sense of solitude which oppresses the child in his
dark room.<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c011'><sup>[152]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This, I take it, would be quite enough to make the
situation of confinement in a dark room disagreeable and depressing
to a wakeful child even when he is in bed and there
is no restriction of bodily activity. But even this would
not amount to a full passionate dread of darkness. It
seems to me to be highly probable that a baby of two or
three months might feel this vague depression and even
this craving for the wonted scene, especially just after the
removal of a light; yet such a baby, as we have seen, gives
no clear indications of <a id='corr215.32'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='fear'>fear.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_215.32'><ins class='correction' title='fear'>fear.</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c001'>Fear of the dark arises from the development of the
child’s imagination, and might, I believe, arise without any
suggestion from nurse or other children of the notion that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>there are bogies in the room. Darkness is precisely the
situation most favourable to vivid imagination: the screening
of the visible world makes the inner world of fancy vivid
and distinct by contrast. Are we not all apt to shut our
eyes when we try to ‘visualise’ or picture things very
distinctly? This fact of a preternatural activity of imagination,
taken with the circumstance emphasised by Rousseau
that in the darkness the child is no longer distinctly
aware of the objects that are actually before him, would
help us to understand why children are so much given to
projecting into the unseen black spaces the creatures of their
imagination. Not only so—and this Rousseau does not
appear to have recognised—the dull feeling of depression
which accompanies the sensation of darkness might suffice
to give a gloomy and weird cast to the images so projected.</p>

<p class='c001'>But I am disposed to think that there is yet another
element in this childish fear. I have said that darkness
gives a positive sensation: we <em>see</em> it, and the sensation, apart
from any difference of signification which we afterwards
learn to give to it, is of the same kind that is obtained by
looking at a dull black surface. To the child the difference
between a black object and a dark unillumined space is as
yet not clear, and I believe it will be found that children
tend to materialise or to ‘reify’ darkness. When, for example,
a correspondent tells me that darkness was envisaged
by her when a child as “a crushing power,” I think I see
traces of this childish feeling. I seem able to recall my
own childish sense of a big black something on suddenly
waking and opening the eyes in a very dark room.</p>

<p class='c001'>But there is still another thing to be noticed in this sensation
of darkness. The black field is not uniform; some
parts of it show less black than others, and the indistinct
and rude pattern of comparatively light and dark changes
from moment to moment; while now and again more definite
spots of brightness may focus themselves. The varying
activity of the retina would seem to account for this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>apparent changing of the black scene. What, my reader
may not unnaturally ask, has this to do with a child’s fear
of the dark? If he will recall what was said about the
facility with which a child comes to see faces and animal
forms in the lines of a cracked ceiling, or the veining of a
piece of marble, he will, I think, recognise the drift of my
remarks. These slight and momentary differences in the
blackness, these fleeting rudiments of a pattern, may serve
as a sensuous base for the projected images; the child with
a strongly excited fancy sees in these dim traces of the
black formless waste definite forms. These will naturally
be the forms with which he is most familiar, and since his
fancy is at the moment tinged with melancholy they will be
gloomy and disturbing forms. Hence we may expect to
hear of children seeing the forms of terrifying living things
in the dark.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here is a particularly instructive case. A boy of four
years had for some time been afraid of the dark and indulged
by having the candle left burning at night. On
hearing that the Crystal Palace had been burned down he
asked for the first time to have the light taken away, fear
of the dark being now cast out by the bigger fear of fire.
Some time after this he volunteered an account of his obsolete
terrors to his father. “Do you know,” he said, “what
I thought dark was? A great large live thing the colour
of black with a mouth and eyes.” Here we have the ‘reifying’
of darkness, and we probably see the influence of the
comparatively bright spots in the attribution of eyes to the
monster, an influence still more apparent in the instance
quoted above, where a child saw the eyes of lions and tigers
glaring as they walked round the room. Another suggestive
instance here is that given by M. Compayré, in which a child
on being asked why he did not like to be in a dark place
answered: “I don’t like chimney-sweeps”.<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c011'><sup>[153]</sup></a> Here the blackness
with its dim suggestions of brighter spots determined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>the image of the black chimney-sweep with his white flashes
of mouth and eyes.<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c011'><sup>[154]</sup></a> I should like to observe here parenthetically
that we still need to learn from children themselves,
by talking to them and inviting their confidence
when the fear of the dark is first noticed, how they are apt
to envisage it.</p>

<p class='c001'>When imagination becomes abnormally active, and the
child is haunted by alarming images, these by recurring
with greatest force in the stillness and darkness of the night
will add to the terrifying associations of darkness. This is
illustrated in the case of the boy Stevens, who was haunted
by the spectre of ‘Cocky’ at night. Dreams, especially of the
horrible nightmare kind to which nervous children are subject,
may invest the dark with a new terror. A child suddenly
waking up and with open eyes seeing the phantom-object of
his dream against the black background may be forgiven for
acquiring a dread of dark rooms. Possibly this experience
gives the clue to the observation already quoted of a boy
who did not want to sleep in a particular room because
there were so many dreams in it.</p>

<p class='c001'>If the above explanation of the child’s fear of the dark
is a sound one Rousseau’s prescription for curing it is not
enough. Children may be encouraged to explore dark
rooms, and by touching blind-like their various objects rendered
familiar with the fact that things remain unchanged
even when enveloped in darkness, that the dark is nothing
but our temporary inability to see things; and this may no
doubt be helpful in checking the fear when calm reflexion
becomes possible. But a radical cure must go farther, must
aim at checking the activity of morbid imagination—and
here what Locke says about the effects of the terrifying stories
of nurses is very much to the point—and in extreme cases
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>must set about strengthening shaky nerves. Mothers would
do well to remember that even religious instruction when
injudiciously presented may add to the terrors of the dark
for these wee tremulous organisms. One observation sent
me strongly suggests that a child may take a strong dislike
to being shut up in the dark with the terrible all-seeing God.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><i>Fears and their Palliatives.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>I have probably illustrated the first fears of children at
sufficient length. Without trying to exhaust the subject
I have, I think, shown that fear of a well-marked and intense
kind is a common feature of the first years of life,
and that it assumes a Protean variety of shapes.</p>

<p class='c001'>Much more will no doubt have to be done in the way
of methodical observation, and more particularly statistical
inquiry into the comparative frequency of the several fears,
the age at which they commonly appear, and so forth,
before we can build up a theory of the subject. One or
two general observations may, however, be hazarded even
at this stage.</p>

<p class='c001'>The thing which strikes one most perhaps in these
early fears is how little they have to do with any remembered
experience of evil. The child is inexperienced, and
if humanely treated knows little of the acuter forms of
human suffering. It would seem at least as if he feared
not because experience had made him apprehensive of
evil, but because he was constitutionally and instinctively
nervous, and possessed with a feeling of insecurity. This
feeling of weakness and insecurity comes to the surface in
presence of what is unknown in so far as this can be
brought by the child’s mind into a relation to his welfare—as
disturbing noises, and the movements of things, especially
when they take on the form of approaches. The
same thing is, as we have seen, illustrated in the fear of the
dark. A like explanation seems to offer itself for other
common forms of fear, especially those excited by others’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>threats, as the dread of the policeman, and little George
Sand’s horror at the idea of being shut up all night in the
‘crystal prison’ of a lamp. The fact that children’s fears
are not the direct product of experience is expressed otherwise
by saying that they are the offspring of the imagination.
A child is apt to be afraid because he fancies things,
and it will probably be demonstrated by statistical evidence
that the most imaginative children (other things
being equal) are the most subject to fear.</p>

<p class='c001'>In certain of these characteristics, at least, children’s
fears resemble those of animals. In both alike fear is
much more an instinctive recoil from the unknown than an
apprehension of known evil. The shying of a horse, the
apparent fear of dogs at certain noises, probably too the
fear of animals at the sight and sound of fire—so graphically
described by Mr. Kipling in the case of the jungle beasts—illustrate
this. Animals too seem to have a sense of the
uncanny, when something apparently uncaused happens,
as when Romanes excited fear in a dog by attaching a fine
thread to a bone, and by surreptitiously drawing it from
the animal, giving to the bone the look of self-movement.
The same dog was frightened by soap-bubbles. According
to Romanes, dogs are frightened by portraits. It is to be
added, however, that in certain of animal fears the influence
of heredity is clearly recognisable, whereas in children’s
fears I have regarded it as doubtful. The fact that a child
is not frightened at fire, which terrifies many animals, seems
to illustrate this difference.<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c011'><sup>[155]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Another instructive comparison is that of children’s fears
with those of savages. Both have a like feeling of insecurity,
and fall instinctively in presence of a big unknown
into the attitude of dread. In the region of superstitious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>fear more particularly, we see how in both a gloomy fancy
forestalls knowledge, investing the new and unexplored with
alarming traits.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lastly, children’s fears have some resemblance to
certain abnormal mental conditions. Idiots, who are so
near normal childhood in their degree of intelligence, show
a marked fear of strangers. More interesting, however,
in the present connexion, is the exaggeration of the
childish fear of new objects which shows itself in certain
mental aberrations. There is a characteristic dread of
newness, neophobia, just as there is a dread of water.<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c011'><sup>[156]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>While, however, these are the dominant characteristics
of children’s fears they are not the only ones. Experience
begins to direct the instinctive fear-impulse from the very
beginning. How much it does in the first months of life
it is difficult to say. In the aversion of a baby to its
medicine glass, or its cold bath, one sees, perhaps, more of
the rude germ of passion or anger than of fear. Careful
observations seem to me to be required on the point, at
what definite date signs of fear arising from experience of
pain begin to show themselves in the child. Some children,
at least, have a surprising way of not minding even considerable
amounts of physical pain: the misery of a fall, a
blow, a cut, and so forth, being speedily forgotten. It
seems doubtful, indeed, whether the venerable saw, ‘The
burnt child dreads the fire,’ is invariably true. It appears,
in many cases at least, to take a good amount of real
agony to produce a genuine fear in a young child.<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c011'><sup>[157]</sup></a> This
tendency to belittle pain is not unknown, I suspect, to the
tutor of small boys. It may well be that a definite and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>precise recalling of the misery of a scratch, or even of a
moderate burn, may not conduce to the development of a
true fear, and that here, too, fear when it arises in all its
characteristic masterfulness is at bottom fear of the unknown.
This seems illustrated by the well-known fact that a child
will be more terrified during a first experience of pain,
especially if there be a visible hurt and bleeding, than by
any subsequent prospect of a renewal of the catastrophe.
Is not the same thing true, indeed, of older fears? Should
we dread the wrench of a tooth-extraction if it were experienced
very often, and we had a sufficiently photographic
imagination to be able to estimate precisely the intensity
and duration of the pain?</p>

<p class='c001'>Much the same thing shows itself in the cases where
fear can be clearly traced to experience and association.
In some of these it is no doubt remembered experience
of suffering which causes the fear. A child that has been
seriously burned will unquestionably be frightened at a too
close approach of a red-hot poker. But in many cases of
this excitation of fear by association it is the primary experience
of fear itself which seems to be the real object of
the apprehension. Thus a child who has been frightened
by a dog will betray signs of fear at the sight of a kennel,
of a picture of a dog, and so forth. The little boy referred
to above who was afraid of the toy elephant that shook its
head showed signs of fear a fortnight afterwards on coming
across a picture of an elephant in a picture-book. In such
ways does fear propagate fear in the timid little breast.</p>

<p class='c001'>One cannot part from the theme of children’s fears
without a reference to a closely connected subject, the
problem of their happiness. To ask whether childhood is
a happy time, still more to ask whether it is the happiest, is
to raise perhaps a foolish and insoluble question. Later
reminiscences would seem in this case to be particularly
untrustworthy. Children themselves no doubt may have
very definite views on the subject. A child will tell you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>with the unmistakable marks of profound conviction that
he is <em>so</em> unhappy. But paradoxical as it may seem, children
really know very little about the matter. At the best
they can only tell you how they feel at particular moments.
To seek for a precise and satisfactory solution of the problem
is thus futile. Only rough comparisons of childhood
and later life are possible.</p>

<p class='c001'>In any such comparison the fears of early years claim,
no doubt, careful consideration. There seem to be people
who have no idea what the agony of these early terrors
amounts to. And since it is the unknown that excites
this fear, and the unknown in childhood is almost everything,
the possibilities of suffering from this source are
great enough.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Alike the Good, the Ill offend thy Sight,</div>
      <div class='line'>And rouse the stormy sense of shrill affright.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>George Sand hardly exaggerates when she writes: “Fear
is, I believe, the greatest moral suffering of children”. In
the case of weakly, nervous and imaginative children, more
especially, this susceptibility to terror may bring miserable
days and yet more miserable nights.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nevertheless, it is easy here to pass from one extreme of
brutal indifference to another of sentimental exaggeration.
Childish suffering is terrible while it lasts, but happily it
has a way of not lasting. The cruel distorting fit of terror
passes and leaves the little face with its old sunny out-look.
It is to be remembered, too, that while children are pitiably
fearful in their own way, they are, as we have seen in the
case of the little Walter Scott, delightfully fearless also, as
judged by our standards. How oddly fear and fearlessness
go together is illustrated in a story sent me. A little boy
fell into a brook. On his being fished out by his mother,
his sister, aged four, asked him: ‘Did you see any crocodiles?’
‘No,’ answered the boy, ‘I wasn’t in long enough.’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>The absence of fear of the water itself was as characteristic
as the presence of fear of the crocodile.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is refreshing to find that in certain cases at least
where older people have done their worst to excite terror,
a child has escaped its suffering. Professor Barnes tells us
that a Californian child’s belief in the supernatural takes
on a happy tone, directing itself to images of heaven with
trees, birds, and other pretty things, and giving but little
heed to the horrors of hell.<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c011'><sup>[158]</sup></a> In less sunny climes than
California children may not, perhaps, be such little optimists,
and it is probable that graphic descriptions of hell-fire
have sent many a creepy thrill of horror along a child’s
tender nerves. Still it may be said that, owing to the
fortunate circumstance of children having much less fear of
fire than many animals, the misery in which eternal punishment
is wont to be bodied forth does not work so powerfully
as one might expect on a child’s imagination. The
author of <cite>The Uninitiated</cite> illustrates a real child-trait when
she makes her small heroine conceive of hell as a place that
<em>smelt</em> nastily (from its <a id='corr224.20'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='brimstone)'>brimstone).</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_224.20'><ins class='correction' title='brimstone)'>brimstone).</ins></a></span><a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c011'><sup>[159]</sup></a> Then it is noticeable
that children in general are but little affected by fear at
the sight or the thought of death. The child C. had a
passing dread of being buried, but his young hopeful heart
refused to credit the fact of that far-off calamity. Other
children, I find, dislike the idea of death as threatening to
deprive them of their mother. Perhaps they can more
readily suppose that somebody else will die than that they
themselves will do so. This comparative immunity from the
dread of death is no small deduction to be made from the
burden of children’s fear.</p>

<p class='c001'>Not only so, when fear is apt to be excited, Nature has
provided the small timorous person with other instincts
which tend to mitigate and even to neutralise it. It is a
happy circumstance that the most prolific excitant of fear,
the presentation of something new and uncanny, is also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>provocative of another feeling, that of curiosity, with its
impulse to look and examine. Even animals are sometimes
divided in the presence of something strange between
fear and curiosity,<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c011'><sup>[160]</sup></a> and children’s curiosity is much
more lively than theirs. A very tiny child, on first making
acquaintance with some form of physical pain, as a
bump on the head, will deliberately repeat the experience
by knocking his head against something as if experimenting
and watching the effect. A clearer case of curiosity
overpowering fear is that of a child who, after pulling the
tail of a cat in a bush and getting scratched, proceeded
to dive into the bush again.<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c011'><sup>[161]</sup></a> Still more interesting here
are the gradual transitions from actual fear before the
new and strange to bold inspection. The child who was
frightened by her Japanese doll insisted on seeing it every
day. The behaviour of one of these small persons on the
arrival at the house of a strange dog, of a dark foreigner,
or some other startling novelty, is a pretty and amusing
sight. The first overpowering timidity, the shrinking back
to the mother’s breast, followed by curious peeps, then by
bolder outstretchings of head and arms, mark the stages by
which curiosity and interest gain on fear and finally leave
it far behind. Very soon we know the small timorous
creatures will grow into bold adventurers. They will
make playthings of the alarming animals, and of the
alarming shadows too.<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c011'><sup>[162]</sup></a> Later on still perhaps they will
love nothing so much as to probe the awful mysteries of
gunpowder.</p>

<p class='c001'>One palliative of these early terrors remains to be
touched on, the instinct of sheltering or refuge-taking.
The first manifestations of what is called the social nature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>of children are little more than the reverse side of their
timidity. A baby will cease crying at night on hearing the
familiar voice of mother or nurse because a vague sense of
human companionship does away with the misery of the
black solitude. A frightened child probably knows an
ecstasy of bliss when folded in the protective embrace of
a mother’s arms. Even the most timid children never
have the full experience of terror so long as there is within
reach the secure base of all their reconnoitring excursions,
the mother’s skirts. Happy those little ones who have ever
near them loving arms within whose magic circle the oncoming
of the cruel fit of terror is instantly checked, giving
place to a delicious calm.</p>

<p class='c001'>How unhappy those children must be who, being
fearsome by nature, lack this refuge, who are left much
alone to wrestle with their horrors as best they may, and
are rudely repulsed when they bear their heart-quakings to
others, I would not venture to say. Still less should I
care to suggest what is suffered by those unfortunates who
find in those about them not comfort, assurance, support in
their fearsome moments, but the worst source of their
terrors. To be brutal to these small sensitive organisms, to
practise on their terrors, to take delight in exciting the
wild stare and wilder shriek of terror, this is perhaps one of
the strange things which make one believe in the old dogma
that the devil can enter into men and women. For here
we seem to have to do with a form of cruelty so exquisite,
so contrary to the oldest of instincts, that it is dishonouring
to the savage and to the lower animals to attempt to refer
it to heredity.</p>

<p class='c001'>To dwell on such things, however, would be to go back
to a pessimistic view of childhood. It is undeniable that
children are exposed to indescribable misery when they
are delivered into the hands of a consummately cruel
guardian. Yet one may hope that this sort of person
is exceptional, something of which we can give no account
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>save by saying that now and again in sport nature
produces a monster, as if to show what she could do if she
did not choose more wisely and benignly to work within
the limitations of type.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>VII. <br /> RAW MATERIAL OF MORALITY.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c017'><i>Primitive Egoism.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Perhaps there has been more hasty theorising about the
child’s moral characteristics than about any other of his
attributes. The very fact that diametrically opposed views
have been put forward is suggestive of this haste. By
certain theologians and others infancy has been painted in
the blackest of moral colours. According to M. Compayré
it is a bachelor, La Bruyère, and a bishop, Dupanloup, who
have said the worst things of children; and the parent or
teacher who wants to see how bad this worst is may consult
M. Compayré’s account.<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c011'><sup>[163]</sup></a> On the other hand, Rousseau and
those who think with him have invested the child with an
untarnished purity. According to Rousseau the child comes
from the Creator’s hand a perfect bit of workmanship,
which blundering man at once begins to mar. Children’s
freedom from human vices has been a common theme of
the poet: their innocence was likened by M. About to the
spotless snow of the Jungfrau. Others, as Wordsworth,
have gone farther and attributed to the infant positive
excellences, glimpses of a higher morality than ours,
Divine intuitions brought from a prenatal existence.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such opposite views of the moral status and worth of a
child must be the result of prepossession, and the magnifying
of the accidents of individual experience. A theologian who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>is concerned to maintain the doctrine of natural depravity,
or a bachelor who happens to have known children chiefly
in the character of little tormentors, may be expected to
paint childhood with black pigments. On the other hand
the poet, attracted by the charm of infancy, may, as we have
seen, easily be led to idealise its moral aspects.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first thing that strikes one in all such attempts to
fix the moral worth of the child is that they are judging of
things by wrong standards. The infant, though it has a
nature capable of becoming moral or immoral, is not as yet
a moral being; and there is a certain impertinence in trying
to force it under our categories of good and bad, pure and
corrupt.</p>

<p class='c001'>If then we would know what the child’s ‘moral’ nature
is like we must be careful to distinguish. By ‘moral’ we
must understand that part of his nature, feelings and
impulses, which has for us a moral significance; whether
as furnishing raw material out of which education may
develop virtuous dispositions, or contrariwise, as constituting
forces adverse to this development. It may be well to
call the former tendencies favourable to virtue, pro-moral,
those unfavourable, contra-moral. Our inquiry, then, must
be: In what respects, and to what extent, does the child
show himself by nature, apart from all that is meant by education,
pro-moral or contra-moral, that is, well or ill fitted to
become a member of a good or virtuous community and to
exercise what we know as moral functions?</p>

<p class='c001'>Our especial object here will be if possible to get at
natural dispositions, to examine the child in his primitive
nakedness, looking out for those instinctive tendencies
which according to modern science are only a little less
clearly marked in the young of our own species than in a
puppy or a chick.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now there is clearly a difficulty here. How, it may
be asked, can we expect to find in a child any traits having
a moral significance which have not been developed by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>social influences and education? In the case of pro-moral
dispositions more particularly, as kindness, or truthfulness,
we cannot expect to get rid of the effect of the combined
personal influence and instruction of the mother, which is
of the essence of all moral training. Even with regard
to contra-moral traits, as rudeness, or lying, it is evident
that example is frequently a co-operating influence.</p>

<p class='c001'>The difficulty is no doubt a real one, and cannot be
wholly got rid of. We cannot completely eliminate the
influence of the common life in which the good and bad
disposition alike may be said to grow up. Yet we may
distinguish. Thus we may look out for the earliest spontaneous
and what we may call original manifestations of
such dispositions as affection and truthfulness, so as to
eliminate the <em>direct</em> action of instruction and example, and
thus to reduce the influence of the social medium on the child
to a minimum. Similarly in the case of brutal and other
unlovely propensities, we may by taking pains get rid of
the influence of bad example.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us see, then, how far the indictment of the child is
a just one. Do children tend spontaneously to manifest
the germs of vicious dispositions, and if so, to what extent?
Here, as I have suggested, we must be particularly careful
not to read wrong interpretations into what we see. It will
not do, for example, to say that children are born thieves
because they show themselves at first serenely indifferent
to the distinction of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>meum</i></span> and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>tuum</i></span>, and are inclined to
help themselves to other children’s toys, and so forth. To
repeat, what we have to inquire is whether children by
their instinctive inclinations are contra-moral, that is, predisposed
to what, if persevered in with reflexion, we call
immorality or vice.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here we cannot do better than touch on that group of
feelings and dispositions which can be best marked off as
anti-social since they tend to the injury of others, such as
anger, envy, and cruelty.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>The most distant acquaintance with the first years of
human life tells us that young children have much in common
with the lower animals. Their characteristic passions and impulses
are centred in self and the satisfaction of its wants.
What is better marked, for example, than the boundless
greed of the child, his keen desire to appropriate and enjoy
whatever presents itself, and to resent others’ participation
in such enjoyment? For some time after birth the child
is little more than an incarnation of appetite which knows
on restraint, and only yields to the undermining force of
satiety.</p>

<p class='c001'>The child’s entrance into social life through a growing
consciousness of the existence of others is marked by much
fierce opposition to their wishes. His greed, which at the
outset was but the expression of a vigorous nutritive
impulse, now takes on more of a contra-moral aspect. The
removal of the feeding-bottle before full satisfaction has
been attained is, as we know, the occasion for one of the
most impressive utterances of the baby’s ‘will to live,’ and
of its resentment of all human checks to its native impulses.
In this outburst we have the first rude germ of that defiance
of control and of authority of which I shall have to say
more by-and-by.</p>

<p class='c001'>In another way, too, the expansion of the infant’s consciousness
through the recognition of others widens the
terrain of greedy impulse. For ugly envy commonly has
its rise in the perception of another child’s consumption of
appetite’s dainties.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here, it is evident, we are still at the level of the animal.
A dog is passionately greedy like the child, will fiercely
resent any interference with the satisfaction of its appetite,
and will be envious of another and more fortunately placed
animal.</p>

<p class='c001'>Much the same concern for self and opposition to others’
having what the child himself desires shows itself in the
matter of toys and other possessions of interest. A child
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>is apt not only to make free with another child’s toys, but
to show the strongest objection to any imitation of this
freedom, often displaying a dog-in-the-manger spirit by
refusing to lend what he himself does not want. Not only
so, he will be apt to resent another child’s having toys of
his own. This envy of other children’s possessions is often
wide and profound.</p>

<p class='c001'>As the social interests come into play so far as to make
caresses and other signs of affection sources of pleasure to
the child, the field for envy and its ‘green-eyed’ offspring,
jealousy, is still more enlarged. As is well known, an infant
will greatly resent the mother’s taking another child
into her arms.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here, again, we are at the level of the lower animals.
They, too, as our dogs and cats can show us, can be envious
not only in the matter of eatables, but in that of human
caressings, and even of possessions—witness the behaviour
of two dogs when a stick is thrown into the water.</p>

<p class='c001'>Full illustrations of these traits of the first years of childhood
are not needed. We all know them. M. Perez and
others have culled a sufficient collection of examples.<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c011'><sup>[164]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Out of all this unrestrained pushing of appetite and
desire whereby the child comes into rude collision with
others’ wants, wishes and purposes, there issue the well-known
passionateness, the angry outbursts, and the fierce
quarrellings of the child. These fits of angry passion or
temper are among the most curious manifestations of childhood,
and deserve to be studied with much greater care
than they have yet received.</p>

<p class='c001'>The outburst of rage as the imperious little will feels
itself suddenly pulled up has in spite of its comicality
something impressive. Hitting out right and left, throwing
things down on the floor and breaking them, howling, wild
agitated movements of the arms and whole body, these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>are the outward vents which the gust of childish fury is
apt to take. Preyer observed one of these violent explosions
in the seventeenth month. The outburst tends to concentrate
itself in an attack on the offender, be this even the beloved
mamma herself. Darwin’s boy at the age of two years
three months became a great adept at throwing books, sticks,
etc., at any one who offended him.<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c011'><sup>[165]</sup></a> But almost anything will
do as an object of attack. A child of four on being crossed
would bang his chair, and then proceed to vent his displeasure
on his unoffending toy lion, banging him, jumping
on him, and, as anti-climax, threatening him with the loss
of his dinner. Hitting is in some cases improved upon by
biting. The boy C. was for some time vigorously mordant
in his angry fits. Another little boy would, under similar
circumstances, bite the carpet.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here we have expressive movements which are plainly
brutal, which assimilate the aspect of an angry child to
that of an infuriated animal. The whole outward attitude
is one of fierce reckless assault. The insane, we are told,
manifest a like wildness of attack in fits of anger, smashing
windows, etc., and striking anybody who happens to be at
hand.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet these are not all the manifestations. Childish anger
has its wretched aspect. There is keen suffering in these
early experiences of thwarted will and purpose. A little
boy, rather more than a year old, used when crossed to
throw himself on the floor and bang the back of his head;
and his brother, when fourteen months old, would similarly
throw himself on the floor, bang the back of his head, biting
the carpet as before mentioned. This act of throwing oneself
on the floor, which is common about this age and
is apparently quite instinctive, is the expression of the utter
<em>dejection</em> of misery. C.’s attitude when crossed, gathered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>into a heap on the floor, was eloquent of this infantile
despair. Such suffering is the immediate outcome of
thwarted purpose, and must be distinguished from the
moral feeling of shame which often accompanies it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such stormy outbursts vary no doubt from child to
child. Thus C.’s sister in her angry moments did not bite
or roll on the floor, but would dance about and stamp.
Some children show little if anything of this savage furiousness.
Among those that do show it, it is often a temporary
phenomenon only.</p>

<p class='c001'>This anger, it is to be noted, is due to check, and would
show itself to some extent even if there were no intervention
of authority. Thus a child will become angry,
resentful, and despairingly miserable if another child gets
effective hold of something which he wants to have. Yet it
is undoubtedly true, as we shall see, that these little storms
are most frequently called up by the imposition of authority,
and are a manifestation of what we call a defiant attitude.</p>

<p class='c001'>This slight examination may suffice to show that with
the child self, its appetites, its satisfactions, are the centre of
its existence, the pivot on which its action turns. I do not
forget the real and striking differences here, the specially
brutal form of boys’ anger as compared with that of girls,
the partial atrophy of some of these impulses, <i>e.g.</i>, jealousy,
in the more gentle and affectionate type of child. Yet
there seems to be little doubt that these are among the
commonest and most pronounced characteristics of the first
years.</p>

<p class='c001'>Evolution will, no doubt, help us to understand much of
this. If the order of development of the individual follows
and summarises that of the race, we should expect the
child to show a germ at least of the passionateness, the
quarrelsomeness of the brute and of the savage before he
shows the moral qualities distinctive of civilised man. That
he often shows so close a resemblance to the savage and to
the brute suggests how little ages of civilised life with its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>suppression of these furious impulses have done to tone
down the ancient and carefully transmitted instincts. The
child at birth, and for a long while after, may then be said
to be the representative of wild untamed nature, which it is
for education to subdue and fashion into something higher
and better.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the same time the child is more than this. In this
first clash of his will with another’s he knows more than
the brute’s sensual fury. He suffers consciously, he realises
himself in his antagonism to a world outside him. It is
probable, as I have pointed out before, that even a physical
check bringing pain, as when the child runs his head
against a wall, may develop this consciousness of self in
its antagonism to a not-self. This consciousness reaches
a higher phase when the opposing force is distinctly apprehended
as another will. Self-feeling, a germ of the feeling
of ‘my worth,’ enters into this early passionateness and
differentiates it from a mere animal rage. The absolute
prostration of infantile anger seems to be the expression
of this keen consciousness of rebuff, of injury.</p>

<p class='c001'>While, then, these outbursts of savage instinct in
children are no doubt ugly, and in their direction contra-moral,
they must not hastily be pronounced wholly bad
and wicked. To call them wicked in the full sense of that
term is indeed to forget that they are the swift reactions of
instinct which have in them nothing of reflexion or of
deliberation. The angry child venting his spite in some
wild act of violence is a long way from a man who knowingly
and with the consent of his will retaliates and hates.
The very fleeting character of the outbreak, the rapid subsidence
of passion and transition to another mood, show
that there is here no real <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>malice prépense</i></span>. These instincts
will, no doubt, if they are not tamed, develop later on into
truly wicked dispositions; yet it is by no means a small
matter to recognise that they do not amount to full moral
depravity.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>On the other hand, we have seen that we do not render
complete justice to these early manifestations of angry
passion if we class them with those of the brute. The child
in these first years, though not yet human in the sense of
having rational insight into his wrong-doing, is human in
the sense of suffering through consciousness of an injured
self. This reflective element is not yet moral; the sense
of injury may turn by-and-by into lasting hatred. Yet it
holds within itself possibilities of something higher. But
of this more when we come to envisage the child in his
relation to authority.</p>

<p class='c001'>The same predominance of self, the same kinship with
the unsocial brute which shows itself in these germinal
animosities, is said to reappear in the insensibility or unfeelingness
of children. The commonest charge against
children from those who are not on intimate terms with
them, and sometimes, alas, from those who are, is that they
are heartless and cruel.</p>

<p class='c001'>That children often appear to the adult as unfeeling
as a stone, is, I suppose, incontestable. The troubles
which harass and oppress the mother leave her small
companion quite unconcerned. He either goes on playing
with undisturbed cheerfulness, or he betrays a momentary
curiosity about some circumstance connected
with the affliction which is worse than the absorption in
play through its tantalising want of any genuine feeling.
A brother or a sister may be ill, but if the vigorous little
player is affected at all, it is only through the loss of his
companion, if this is not more than made up for by certain
advantages of the solitary situation. If the mother is ill,
the event is interesting merely as supplying him with
new treats. A little boy of four, after spending half an
hour in his mother’s sick-room, coolly informed his nurse:
‘I have had a very nice time, mamma’s ill!’ The order of
the two statements is significant of the child’s mental
attitude towards others’ sufferings. If his faithful nurse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>has her face bandaged, his interest in her torments does not go
beyond a remark on the ‘funniness’ of her new appearance.</p>

<p class='c001'>When it comes to the bigger human troubles this want
of fellow-feeling is still more noticeable. Nothing is more
shocking to the adult observer of children than their
coldness and stolidity in presence of death. While a
whole house is stricken with grief at the loss of a beloved
inmate the child is wont to preserve his serenity, being
affected at most by a feeling of awe before a great mystery.
Even the sight of the dead body does not always excite
grief. Mrs. Burnett in her interesting reminiscences of
childhood has an excellent account of the feelings of a
sensitive and refined child when first brought face to face
with death. In one case she was taken with fearsome
longing to touch the dead body, so as to know what
‘as cold as death’ meant, in another, that of a pretty girl of
three with golden brown eyes and neat small brown curls,
she was impressed by the loveliness of the whole scene,
the nursery bedroom being hung with white and adorned
with white flowers. In neither case was she sorry, and could
not cry though she had imagined beforehand that she would.<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c011'><sup>[166]</sup></a>
Even in this case, then, where so much feeling was called
forth, commiseration for the dead companion seems to
have been almost wholly wanting.<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c011'><sup>[167]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>No one, I think, will doubt that judged by our standards
children are often profoundly and shockingly callous. But
the question arises here, too, whether we are right in
applying our grown-up standards. It is one thing to be
indifferent with full knowledge of suffering, another to be
indifferent in the sense in which a cat might be said to
be so at the spectacle of your falling or burning your
finger. We are apt to assume that children know our
sufferings instinctively, or at least that they can always
enter into them when they are openly expressed. But this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>assumption is highly unreasonable. A large part of the
manifestation of human suffering is unintelligible to a
little child. He is oppressed neither by our anxieties nor
by our griefs, just because these are to a large extent
beyond his sympathetic comprehension.</p>

<p class='c001'>We must remember, too, that there are moods and
attitudes of mind favourable and unfavourable to sympathy.
None of us are uniformly and consistently compassionate,
and children are frequently the subject of
moods which exclude the feeling. They are impelled by
their superabundant nervous energy to wild romping
activity, they are passionately absorbed in their play,
they are intensely curious about the many new things
they see and hear of. These dominant impulses issue in
mental attitudes which are indifferent to the spectacle of
others’ troubles.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, where an appeal to serious attention is given, a
child is apt to spy something besides the sadness. The
little girl already spoken of saw the prettiness of the death-room
rather than its mournfulness. A teacher once told
her class of the death of a class-mate. There was of course
a strange stillness, which one little girl presently broke
with a loud laugh. The child is said to have been by no
means unemotional, and the laugh not a ‘nervous’ one.
The odd situation—the sudden hush of a class—had affected
childish sensibilities more than the distressing announcement.</p>

<p class='c001'>One other remark by way of saving clause here. It is
by no means true that children are always unaffected by
the sad and sorrowful things in life. The first acquaintance
with death, as we know from a number of published reminiscences,
has sometimes shaken a child’s whole being with
an infinite, nameless sense of woe.<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c011'><sup>[168]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>Children, says the misopædist, are not only unfeeling
where we look for sympathy and kindness, they are positively
unkind, their unkindness amounting to cruelty. What
we mean by the brute in the child is emphatically this
cruelty. By cruelty is here understood cold-blooded infliction
of pain. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Cet âge,”</span> wrote La Fontaine of childhood,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“est sans pitié.”</span> The idea that children, especially
boys, are cruel in this sense is, I think, a common one.</p>

<p class='c001'>This cruelty will now and again show itself in relation
to other children. One of the trying situations of early
life is to find oneself supplanted by the arrival of a new
baby. Children, I have reason to think, are, in such circumstances,
capable of coming shockingly near to a feeling
of hatred. I have heard of one little girl who was taken
with so violent an antipathy to a baby which she considered
outrageously ugly as to make attempts to smash its head,
much as she would no doubt have tried to destroy a doll
which had become unsightly to her. The baby, it is comforting
to know, was not really hurt by this precocious
explosion of infanticidal impulse—perhaps the smashing
was more than half a "pretence"—and the little girl has
since grown up to be a kind-hearted woman.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such cruel-looking handling of smaller infants is probably
rare. More common is the exhibition of the signs
of cruelty in the child’s dealings with animals. It is of
this, indeed, that we mostly think when we speak of a
child’s cruelty.</p>

<p class='c001'>At first nothing seems clearer than the evidence of
malicious intention in a child’s treatment of animals. The
little girl M. when just a year old would lift two kittens by
the neck and try to stamp on them. The little girl described
by Miss Shinn would when two years old run up to a dog
and jerk his ear till he snapped at her, and on one occasion
resolutely thrust her hand into a bush to seize pussy, minding
not the scratches.<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c011'><sup>[169]</sup></a> Do we not see in this mauling of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>animals, even when it brings the child himself pain, evidences
of a rooted determination to plague, and of a fierce
delight in plaguing?</p>

<p class='c001'>The question of the innermost nature of human cruelty
is too difficult a one to be discussed here. I will only say
that whatever the cruelty of adults may be children’s so-called
cruelty towards animals is very far from being a
pure delight in the sight of suffering. The torments to
which a child will subject a long-suffering cat are, I suspect,
due not to a clear intention to inflict pain, but to the
childish impulse to hold, possess, and completely dominate
the pet animal. He feels he must have the pet, no matter
at what cost to himself: of the cost to his victim he does
not think. The stamping on the kittens was perhaps
merely a childish way of holding them fast. Such actions
are a manifestation of that odd mixture of sociability and
love of power which makes up a child’s attachment to the
lower animals.</p>

<p class='c001'>The case of destructive cruelty, as when a small boy
crushes a fly, is somewhat different. Let me give a well-observed
instance. A little boy of two years and two
months, "after nearly killing a fly on the window-pane,
seemed surprised and disturbed, looking round for an explanation,
then gave it himself: ‘Mr. Fy dom (gone) to
by-by’. But he would not touch it or another fly again—a
doubt evidently remained and he continued uneasy about
it." Here we have, I think, the instinctive attitude of a
child towards the outcome of his destructive impulse.
This impulse, which, as we know, becomes more clearly
destructive when experience has taught what result will
follow, is not necessarily cruel in the sense of including an
idea of the animal’s suffering. Animal movement, especially
that of tiny things, has something exciting and provoking
about it. The child’s own activity and the love of power
which is bound up with it impel him to arrest the movements
of small manageable things. This is the meaning,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>I suspect, of the fascination of the fly on the window-pane,
and of tiny creeping things, and especially, perhaps, of the
worm with its tangle of wriggling movement. The cat’s
prolonged chase of the mouse, into which, as we have seen,
something of a dramatic make-believe enters, probably
owes its zest to a like delight in the realisation of power.</p>

<p class='c001'>Along with this love of power there goes often something
of a child’s fierce untamable curiosity. A boy of
four, finding that his mother was shocked at hearing him
express a wish to see a pigeon which a dog had just killed,
remarked: ‘Is it rude to look at a dead pigeon? I want
to see where its blood is.’ I am disposed to think that
the crushing of flies and moths and the pulling of worms
to pieces and so forth are prompted by this curiosity. The
child wants to see where the blood is, what the bones are
like, how the wings are fastened in, and so forth. Perez
tells of a little boy, afterwards an artist, who used to
crush flies between the leaves of a book for the sake of the
odd designs resulting.<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c011'><sup>[170]</sup></a> By such various lines of concentrated
activity does the child-mind overlook the suffering
which it causes.</p>

<p class='c001'>A like combination of love of power and of curiosity
seems to underlie other directions of childish destructiveness,
as the breaking of toys and the pulling of flowers to
pieces. In certain cases, as in C.’s annihilation of a garden
of peonies, the love of power or effect may overtop and
outlive the curiosity, becoming a sort of iconoclastic fury.<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c011'><sup>[171]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>I think, then, that we may give the little child the benefit
of the doubt, and not assign his rough handling of sentient
things to a wish to inflict pain, or even to an indifference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>to pain of which he is clearly aware. Wanton activity, the
curiosity of the experimenter, and delight in showing one’s
power and producing an effect, seem sufficient to explain
most of the alleged brutality of the first years.</p>

<p class='c001'>Probably the same considerations apply to those milder
forms of annoyance which children are apt to practise on
other people and animals alike. That a child early develops
a decided taste for ‘teasing’ is, I think, certain. But
whether carried out by word or by action this early teasing
seems to be in the main the outcome of the love of power,
the impulse to impose one’s will on other creatures. We
must remember that these wee beings feel themselves so
subject to others’ power that they are very naturally driven
to use all opportunities of shaking off the shackles, and
exercising for themselves a little domination. Cruelty, that
is the impulse to inflict pain, where it appears, grows up
later, and though it has its roots in this love of power ought
to be distinguished from it.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have now looked at one of the dark sides of the
child and have found that though it is unpleasant it is not
so hideous as it has been painted. Children are no doubt
apt to be passionate, ferocious in their anger, and sadly
wanting in consideration for others; yet it is consolatory
to reflect that their savageness is not quite that of brutes,
and that their selfishness and cruelty are a long way removed
from a deliberate and calculating egoism.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><i>Germs of Altruism.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>It now remains to point out that there is another and
counterbalancing side. If a child has his outbursts of
temper he has also his fits of tenderness. If he is now dead
to others’ sufferings he is at another time taken with a most
amiable childish concern for their happiness. In order to
be just to him we must recognise both sides.</p>

<p class='c001'>It must not be forgotten here that children are instinctively
attachable and sociable in so far as they show in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>first weeks that they get used to and dependent on the
human presence and are miserable when this is taken from
them. The stopping of an infant’s crying at night on hearing
the familiar voice of its mother or nurse shows this.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this instinct of companionship there is involved a
vague inarticulate sympathy. Just as the attached dog
may be said to have in a dim fashion a feeling of oneness
with its master, so the child. The intenser realisation of
this oneness comes in the case of the dog and of the child
alike after separation. The wild caressing leaps of the
quadruped are matched by the warm embracings of the
little biped. Only that here, too, we see in the child traces
of a deeper human consciousness. A girl of thirteen
months was separated from her mother during six weeks.
On the mother’s return she was speechless, and for some
time could not bear to leave her restored companion for a
minute. The little girl M. when nearly seventeen months old
received her father after only five days’ absence with special
marks of tenderness, rushing up to him, smoothing and
stroking his face and giving him all the toys in the room.</p>

<p class='c001'>This sense of joining on one’s existence to another’s
is not sympathy in its highest form, that is, a conscious
realisation of another’s feelings, but it is a kind of sympathy
after all, and may grow into something better. This we
may see in the return of the childish heart to its resting
place after the estrangement introduced by <a id='corr243.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='‘naughtiness’'>‘naughtiness’.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_243.26'><ins class='correction' title='‘naughtiness’'>‘naughtiness’.</ins></a></span>
The relenting after passion, the reconciliation after punishment,
are these not the experiences which help to raise the
dumb animal sympathy of the first months into a true
human sense of fellowship? But this part of the development
of sympathy belongs to another chapter.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sympathy, it has been said, is a kind of imitation, and
this is strikingly illustrated in its early forms. A dog will
howl piteously in response to another dog’s howl: similarly
a child of nine and a half months has been known to cry
violently when his mother or father pretended to cry.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>One curious manifestation of this early imitative sympathy
is the impulse to do what the mother does and to be
what she is. Much of early imitative play shows this
tendency. It is more than a cold distant copying of
another’s doings: it is full of the warmth of attachment,
and it is entered on as a way of getting nearer to the object
of attachment. Out of this, too, there springs the germ of
a higher sympathy. It will be remembered that Laura
Bridgman bound the eyes of her doll with a bandage
similar to the one she herself wore. Through this sharing
in her own experience the doll became more a part of
herself. Conversely, a child, on finding that her mother’s
head ached, began imitatively to make-believe that her own
head was hurt. Sympathy rests on community of experience,
and it is a curious fact that a child, before he can fully
sympathise with another’s trouble and make it his own by
the sympathetic process itself, should thus try by a kind of
childish acting to realise this community of experience.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this imitative acting of another’s trouble, so as to
share in it, there is but a step to a direct sympathetic
apprehension of it. How early a genuine manifestation of
concern about another’s suffering begins to show itself it is
almost impossible to say. Children probably differ greatly
in this respect. I have, however, one case which is so
curious that I cannot forbear to quote it. It reaches me, I
may say, by a thoroughly trustworthy channel.</p>

<p class='c001'>A baby aged one year and two months was crawling
on the floor. An elder sister, Katherine, aged six, who
was working at a wool mat could not get on very well
and began to cry. Baby looked up and grunted, ‘on! on!’
and kept drawing its fingers down its own cheeks. Here
the aunt called Miss Katherine’s attention to baby, a
device which merely caused a fresh outburst of tears;
whereupon baby proceeded to hitch itself along to
Katherine with many repetitions of the grunts and the
mimetic finger-movements. Katherine, fairly overcome
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>by this, took baby to her and smiled; at which baby
began to clap its hands and to crow, tracing this time
the course of the tears down its sister’s cheeks.</p>

<p class='c001'>This pretty nursery-picture certainly seems to illustrate
a rudiment of genuine fellow-feeling. Similarly it is hard
not to recognise the signs of a sincere concern when a child
of two runs spontaneously and kisses the place that is hurt,
even though it is not to be doubted that the graceful action
has been learnt through imitation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Very sweet and sacred to the mother are the first clear
indications of the child’s concern for herself. These are
sporadic, springing up rarely, and sometimes, as it looks
to us, capriciously. Illness, and temporary removal are a
common occasion for the appearance of a deeper tenderness
in the young heart. A little boy of three spontaneously
brought his story-book to his mother when she
lay in bed ill; and the same child used to follow her about
after her recovery with all the devotion of a little knight.</p>

<p class='c001'>Valuable and entertaining, too, are the first attempts of
the child at consolation. A little German girl aged two
and a half who had just lost her brother seemed very
indifferent for some days. She then began to reflect and to
ask about her playmate. On seeing her mother’s distress
she proceeded in truly childish fashion to comfort her;
‘Never mind, mamma, you will get a better boy. He
<em>was</em> a ragamuffin’ (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">‘Er <em>war</em> ein Lump’</span>). The co-existence
of an almost barbarous indifference for the dead brother
with practical sympathy for the living mother is characteristic
here.<a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c011'><sup>[172]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>A deeper and more thoughtful sympathy comes with
years and reflective power. Thought about the overhanging
terror, death, is sometimes the awakener of this. ‘Are you
old, mother?’ asked a boy of five. ‘Why?’ she answered.
‘Because,’ he continued, ‘the older you are the nearer you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>are to dying.’ This child had once before said he hoped
his mother would not die before him, and this suggests that
thought of his own forlorn condition was in his mind here:
yet we may hope that there was something of disinterested
concern too.<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c011'><sup>[173]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This early consideration frequently takes the practical
form of helpfulness. A child loves nothing better than to
assist you in little household occupations; and though love
of activity and the pleasure of imitating no doubt count for
much in these cases, we can, I think, safely set down something
to the wish to be of use. This inference seems
justified by the fact that such practical helpfulness is not
always imitative. A little boy of two years and one month
happened to overhear his nurse say to herself: ‘I wish that
Anne would remember to fill the nursery boiler’. “He
listened, and presently trotted off; found the said Anne
doing a distant grate, pulled her by the apron, saying:
‘Nanna, Nanna!’ (come to nurse). She followed, surprised
and puzzled, the child pulling all the way, till, having
got her into the nursery, he pointed to the boiler, and
added: ‘Go dare, go dare,’ so that the girl comprehended
and did as he bade her.”</p>

<p class='c001'>With this practical ‘utilitarian’ sympathy there goes
a quite charming wish to give pleasure in other ways. A
little girl when just a year old was given to offering her
toys, flowers, and other pretty things to everybody. Generosity
is as truly an impulse of childhood as greediness, and
it is odd to observe their alternate play. At an early age,
too, a child tries to make himself agreeable by pretty and
dainty courtesies. A little girl, aged three and a quarter,
petitioned her mother this wise: ‘Please, mamma, will you
pin this with the greatest pleasure?’ Regard for another’s
feelings was surely never more charmingly expressed than
in the prayer that in rendering this little service the helper
should not only be willing, but glad.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>Just as there are these sporadic growths of affectionate
concern and wish to please in relation to the mother and
others, so there is ample evidence of kindness to animals.
The charge of cruelty in the case of little children is, indeed,
seen to be a gross libel as soon as we consider their whole
behaviour towards the animal world.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have touched above on the vague alarms which this
animal world has for tiny children. It is only fair to
them to say that these alarms are for the most part
transitory, giving place to interest, attachment and fellow-feeling.
In a sense a child may be said to belong to the
animal community, as Mr. Rudyard Kipling’s charming
account of the Jungle prettily suggests. Has he not,
indeed, at first more in common with the dog and cat, the
pet rabbit or dormouse, than with that grown-up human
community which is apt to be so preoccupied with things
beyond his understanding, and in many cases, at least, to
wear so unfriendly a mien? We must remember, too, that
children as a rule know nothing of the prejudices, of the
disgusts, which make grown people put animals so far
from them. The boy C. was nonplussed by his mother’s
horror of the caterpillar. A child has been known quite
spontaneously to call a worm ‘beautiful’.</p>

<p class='c001'>As soon as the first fear of the strangeness is mastered
a child will take to an animal. A little boy of fifteen
months quickly overcame his fright at the barking of his
grandfather’s dog, and began to share his biscuits with him,
to give him flowers to smell, and to throw stones for his
amusement. This mastery of fear by attachment takes a
higher form when later on the child will stick to his dumb
companion after suffering from his occasional fits of temper.
Ruskin in his reminiscences gives a striking example of this
triumph of attachment over fear. When five years old, he
tells us, he was taken by the serving-man to see a favourite
Newfoundland dog in the stable. The man rather foolishly
humoured the child’s wish to kiss Leo (the dog) and lowered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>him so that his face came near the animal’s. Hereupon the
dog, who was dining, resenting the interruption of his meal,
bit out a piece of the boy’s lip. His only fear after this was
lest the dog should be sent away.<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c011'><sup>[174]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Children will further at a quite early age betray the
germ of a truly humane feeling towards animals. The same
little boy that bravely got over his fear of the dog’s barking
would, when nineteen months old, begin to cry on seeing a
horse fall in the street. More passionate outbursts of pity
are seen at a later age. A boy five years and nine months
had a kitten of which he was very fond. One day, after
two or three days’ absence from the house, it came back with
one foot much mutilated and the leg swollen, evidently not
far from dying. “When (writes the mother) he saw it he
burst into uncontrollable tears and was more affected than
I have ever seen him. The kitten was taken away and
drowned, and ever since (a month) he has shown great
reluctance in speaking of it, and never mentions it to any
one but those who saw the cat at the time. He says it is
too sad to tell any one of it.” The boy C. when only four
was moved to passionate grief at the sight of a dead dog
taken from a pond.</p>

<p class='c001'>The indignation of children at the doings of the butcher,
the hunter and others, shows how deeply pitiful consideration
for animals is rooted in their hearts. This is one of
the most striking manifestations of the better side of child-nature
and deserves a chapter to itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is sometimes asked why children should take animals
to their bosoms in this fashion and lavish so much fellow-feeling
on them. It seems easy to understand how they
come to choose animals, especially young ones, as playmates,
and now and again to be ruthlessly inconsiderate of
their comfort in their boisterous gambols; but why should
they be so affected by their sufferings and champion their
rights so sturdily? I think the answer is not hard to find.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>The sympathy and love which the child gives to animals
grow out of a sort of blind gregarious instinct, and this
again seems to be rooted in a similarity of position and
needs. As M. Compayré well says on this point: “He (the
child) sympathises naturally with creatures which resemble
him on so many sides, in which he finds wants analogous
to his own, the same appetite, the same impulses to movement,
the same desire for caresses. To resemble is already
to love.”<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c011'><sup>[175]</sup></a> I think, however, that a deeper feeling comes in
from the first and gathers strength as the child hears about
men’s treatment of animals, I mean a sense of a common
danger and helplessness face to face with the human ‘giant’.
The more passionate attachment of the child to the animal
is the outcome of the wide-spread instinct of helpless things
to band together. A mother once remarked to her boy,
between five and six years old: ‘Why, R., I believe you are
kinder to the animals than to me’. ‘Perhaps I am,’ he
replied, ‘you see they are not so well off as you are.’ May
there not be something of this sense of banding and mutual
defence on the animals’ side too? The idea does not look so
absurd when we remember how responsive, how forbearing,
how ready to defend, a dog will often show itself towards
a ‘wee mite’ of a child. This same instinct to stand up
for the helpless inferior shows itself in children’s attitude
towards servants when scolded and especially when dismissed.<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c011'><sup>[176]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The same outpourings of affection are seen in the
dealings of children with their toy babies and animals.
Allowing for occasional outbreaks of temper and acts of
violence, the child’s intercourse with his doll and his toy
‘gee gee’ is a wonderful display of loving solicitude; a
solicitude which is at once tender and corrective and has
the enduring constancy of a maternal instinct. No one
can watch the care given to a doll, the wide-ranging efforts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>to provide for its comfort, to make it look pretty, and
to get it to behave nicely, and note the misery when it
is missing, without acknowledging that in this plaything
humanised by childish fancy, and brought by daily habit
into the warmest intimacy of daily companionship, we have
the focal meeting-point of the tender impulses of the child.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lastly, the reader may be reminded that childish kindness
and pitifulness extend to what look to us still less
deserving objects in the inanimate world. The manifestations
of pity for the falling leaves and for the stones condemned
to lie always in one place, referred to above, show
how quick childish feeling is to detect what is sad in the
look of things. Children have even been known to apply
the commiserating vocable ‘poor’ to a torn paper figure,
and to a bent pin. It seems fair to suppose that here,
too, the more tender heart of the child saw occasion for
pity.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is worth noting that childish sorrow at the sufferings
of things is sometimes so keen, that even artistic descriptions
which contain a ‘cruel’ element are shunned. A
little boy under four "is indignant (writes his mother) at
any picture where an animal suffers. He has even turned
against several of his favourite pictures—German Bilderbogen,
because they are ‘cruel,’ as the bear led home with
a corkscrew in his nose." The extreme manifestation of
this shrinking from the representation of animal or human
suffering is dislike for ‘sad stories’. The unsophisticated
tender heart of the child can find no pleasure in horrors
which appear to be the supreme delight of many an adult
reader.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here, however, it is evident, we verge on the confines
of sentimental pity. It is to be remarked that highly
imaginative children shed most tears over these fictitious
sufferings. Children with more matter-of-fact minds and
a practical turn are not so affected. Thus a mother writes
of her two girls: ‘M. being the most imaginative is and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>always has been much affected by sad stories, especially
if read to her with dramatic inflexions of voice. From two
years old upwards these have always affected her to tears,
whilst P. who is really the most tender-hearted and helpful,
but has little imagination, never cries at sad stories, and
when four years old explained to me that she did not
mind them because she knew they didn’t really happen.’</p>

<p class='c001'>It appears to me to be incontestable that in this spontaneous
outgoing of fellow-feeling towards other creatures,
human and animal, the child manifests something of a
truly moral quality. C.’s stout and persistent championship
of the London horses against the oppression of the
bearing-rein had in it something of righteous indignation.
The way in which his mind was at this period pre-occupied
with animal suffering suggests that his sympathies with
animals were rousing the first fierce protest against the
wicked injustice of the world. The boy De Quincey got
this first sense of the existence of moral evil in another
way through his sympathy with a sister who, rumour said,
had been brutally treated by a servant. He could not, he
tells us, bear to look on the woman. It was not anger.
‘The feeling which fell upon me was a shuddering horror
as upon a first glimpse of the truth that I was in a world
of evil and <a id='corr251.24'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='strife.”'>strife.’</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_251.24'><ins class='correction' title='strife.”'>strife.’</ins></a></span><a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c011'><sup>[177]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'><i>Children’s Lies.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>We may now turn to the other main charge against
children, that of lying. According to many, children are
in general accomplished little liars, to the manner born
and equally adept with the mendacious savage. Even
writers on childhood, by no means prejudiced against them,
lean to the view that untruth is universal among children,
and to some extent at least innate.<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c011'><sup>[178]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>Here, surely, there is need of discrimination. A lie
connotes, or should connote, an assertion made with full
consciousness of its untruth, and in order to mislead. It
may well be doubted whether little children have so clear
an apprehension of what we understand by truth and
falsity as to be liars in this full sense. Much of what
seems shocking to the adult unable to place himself at
the level of childish intelligence and feeling will probably
prove to be something far less serious. It is satisfactory
to note a tendency to take a milder and more reasonable
view of this infantile fibbing; and in what follows I can
but follow up the excellent recent studies of Dr. Stanley
Hall, and M. Compayré.<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c011'><sup>[179]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It is desirable to inspect a little more closely the
various forms of this early mendacity. To begin with
those little ruses and dissimulations which, according to
M. Perez, are apt to appear almost from the cradle in the
case of certain children, it is plainly difficult to bring them
into the category of full-fledged lies. When, for example,
a child wishing to keep a thing hides it, and on your
asking for it holds out empty hands, it would be hard to
name this action a lie, even though there is in it a germ
of deception. We must remember that children have an
early developed instinct to secrete things, and the little
dissimulation in these actions may be a mere outcome
of this hiding propensity, and the accompanying wish that
you should not get the hidden thing. Refusals to tell
secrets, or as C. called them ‘private secrets’ (a fine distinction),
show the same thing. A child when badgered
is most jealous in guarding what he has been told, or what
his fancy has made a secret. The little ruses or ‘acted lies’
to which I am now referring seem to me at the worst
attempts to put you off the scent in what is regarded as a
private matter, and to have the minimum of intentional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>deception. As Mrs. Fry has well shown, this childish
passion for keeping things secret may account for later
and more serioua-looking falsehoods.<a id='r180' /><a href='#f180' class='c011'><sup>[180]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>More distinct marks of mendacity appear when the
child comes to use language and proffers statements which
if he reflected he might know to be false. It may readily be
thought that no child who has the intelligence to make
statements at all could make false ones without some little
consciousness of the falsity. But here I suspect we judge
harshly, applying adult tests to cases where they are inappropriate.
Anybody who has observed children’s play and
dramatic talk, and knows how readily and completely they
can imagine the non-existent so as to lose sight of the
existent, will be chary when talking of them of using the
word lie. There may be solemn sticklers for truth who
would be shocked to hear the child when at play saying,
‘I am a coachman,’ ‘Dolly is crying,’ and so forth. But
the discerning see nothing to be alarmed at here. Similarly
when a little girl of two and a half after running on
with a pretty long rigmarole of sounds devoid of all meaning
said: “It’s because you don’t understand me, papa”.
Here the love of mystery and secrecy aided by the dramatic
impulse <em>made</em> the nonsense talk real talk. The wee
thing doubtless had a feeling of superiority in talking in a
language which was unintelligible to her all-wise papa.</p>

<p class='c001'>On much the same level of moral obliquity are those
cases where a child will say the opposite of what he is told,
turning authoritative utterances upside down. A quaint
instance is quoted by Compayré from Guyau. Guyau’s
little boy (age not given) was overheard saying to himself:
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Papa parle mal, il a dit <em>sevette</em>, bébé parle bien, il dit
<em>serviette</em>”</span>. Such reversals are a kind of play too: the child
not unnaturally gets tired now and then of being told that
he is wrong, and for the moment imagines himself right
and his elders wrong, immensely enjoying the idea.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>A graver-looking case presents itself when an ‘untruth’
is uttered in answer to a question. C. on being asked by
his mother who told him something, answered, ‘Dolly’.
‘False, and knowingly false,’ somebody will say, especially
when he learns that the depraved youngster instantly proceeded
to laugh. But let us look a little closer. The
question had raised in C.’s small mind the idea that somebody
had told him. This is a process of ‘suggestion’
which, as we shall see presently, sways a child’s mind as it
sways that of the hypnotised adult. And there close by
the child was dolly, and the child’s make-believe includes,
as we all know, much important communication with dolly.
What more natural than that the idea should at once seize
his imagination? But the laugh? Well I am ready to
admit that there was a touch of playful defiance here, of
young impishness. The expression on the mother’s face
showed him that his bold absurd fancy had produced its
half-startling, half-amusing effect; and there is nothing
your little actor likes more than this after-effect of startling
you. But more, it gave him at the same instant a glimpse
of the outside look of his fancy, of the unreality of the
untruth; and the laugh probably had in it the delight of
the little rebel, of the naughty rogue who loves now and
then to set law at defiance.</p>

<p class='c001'>A quick vivid fancy, a childish passion for acting a part,
these backed by a strong impulse to astonish, and a
turn for playful rebellion, seem to me to account for this
and other similar varieties of early misstatement. Naughty
they no doubt are in a measure; but is it not just that playing
at being naughty which has in it nothing really bad,
and is removed <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>toto cœlo</i></span> from downright honest lying? I
speak the more confidently as to C.’s case as I happen to
know that he was in his serious moods particularly, one
might almost say pedantically, truthful.</p>

<p class='c001'>A somewhat different case is that where the vivid fancy
underlying the misstatement may be supposed to lead to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>measure of self-deception. When, for example, a child
wants to be carried and says, “My leg hurts me and my
foot too just here, I can’t walk, I can’t, I can’t,”<a id='r181' /><a href='#f181' class='c011'><sup>[181]</sup></a> it is
possible at least that he soon realises the tiredness he
begins by half feigning. The Worcester collection gives an
example. “I was giving some cough syrup, and E (aged
three years two months) ran to me saying: ‘I am sick too,
and I want some medicine’. She then tried to cough.
Every time she would see me taking the syrup bottle
afterwards, she would begin to cough. The syrup was very
sweet.” This looks simply awful. But what if the child
were of so imaginative a turn that the sight of the syrup
given to the sick child produced a more or less complete
illusion of being herself sick, an illusion strong enough to
cause the irritation and the cough? The idea may seem
far-fetched, but deserves to be considered before we brand
the child with the name liar.</p>

<p class='c001'>The vivid fanciful realisation which in this instance was
sustained by the love of sweet things is in many cases
inspired by other and later developed feelings. How much
false statement—and that not only among little children—is
of the nature of exaggeration and directed to producing
a strong effect. When, for example, the little four-year-old
draws himself up and shouts exultantly, “See, mamma, how
tall I am, I am growing so fast, I shall soon be a giant,” or
boasts of his strength and tells you the impossible things he
is going to do, the element of braggadocio is on the surface,
and imposes on nobody.</p>

<p class='c001'>No doubt these propensities, though not amounting in
the stage of development now dealt with to full lying, may
if unrestrained develop into this. An unbridled fancy
and strong love of effect will lead an older child to say
what he knows, vaguely at least, at the moment to be
false in order to startle and mystify others. Such exaggeration
of the impulses is distinctly abnormal, as may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>seen by its affinity to what we can observe in the case of
the insane. The same is true of the exaggeration of the
vain-glorious or ‘showing off’ impulses, as illustrated for
example in the cases mentioned by Dr. Stanley Hall of
children who on going to a new town or school would
assume new characters which were kept up with difficulty
by means of many false pretences.<a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c011'><sup>[182]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>A fertile source of childish untruth, especially in the
case of girls, is the wish to please. Here we have to do
with very dissimilar things. An emotional child who in a
sudden fit of tenderness for mother, aunt or teacher gushes
out, ‘Oh I <em>do</em> love you,’ or ‘What sweet lovely eyes you
have,’ or other pretty flattery, may be sincere for the moment,
the exaggeration being indeed the outcome of a sudden
ebullition of emotion. There is more of acting and artfulness
in the flatteries which take their rise in a calculating
wish to say the nice agreeable thing. Some children are,
I believe, adepts at these amenities. Those in whom the
impulse is strong and dominant are presumably those who
in later years make the good society actors. In all this
childish simulation and exaggeration we have to do with
the germs of what may become a great moral evil, insincerity,
that is falsity in respect of what is best and ought to be
sacred. Yet this childish flattery, though undoubtedly a
mild mendacity, is a most amiable mendacity through its
charming motive—always supposing that it is a pure wish
to please, and is not complicated with an <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>arrière pensée</i></span>, the
hope of gaining some favour from the object of the devotion.
Perhaps there is no variety of childish fault more difficult
to deal with; if only for the reason that in checking the
impulse we are robbing ourselves of the sweetest offerings
of childhood.</p>

<p class='c001'>The other side of this wish to please is the fear
to give offence, and this, I suspect, is a fertile source of
childish prevarication. If, for example, a child is asked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>whether he does not like or admire something, his feeling
that the questioner expects him to say ‘Yes’ makes it very
hard to say ‘No’. Mrs. Burnett gives us a reminiscence of
this early experience. When she was less than three, she
writes, a lady visitor, a friend of her mother, having found
out that the baby newly added to the family was called
Edith, remarked to her: ‘That’s a pretty name. My baby
is Eleanor. Isn’t that a pretty name?’ On being thus
questioned she felt in a dreadful difficulty, for she did not
like the sound of ‘Eleanor,’ and yet feared to be rude and
say so. She got out of it by saying she did not like the
name as well as ‘Edith’.</p>

<p class='c001'>These temptations and struggles, which may impress
themselves on memory for the whole of life, illustrate the
influence of older persons’ wishes and expectations on the
childish mind. It is possible that we have here to do with
something akin to “suggestion,” that force which produces
such amazing results on the hypnotised subject, and is
known to be a potent influence for good or for evil on the
young mind. A leading question of the form, ‘Isn’t this
pretty?’ ‘Aren’t you fond of me?’ may easily overpower
for a moment the child’s own conviction super-imposing
that of the stronger mind. Such passive utterance coming
from a mind over-ridden by another’s authority is not to be
confounded with conscious falsehood.</p>

<p class='c001'>This suggestion often combines with other <a id='corr257.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='forces'>forces.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_257.26'><ins class='correction' title='forces'>forces.</ins></a></span>
Here is a good example. A little American girl, sent into
the oak shrubbery to get a leaf, saw a snake, which so
frightened her that she ran home without the leaf. As
cruel fate would have it she met her brothers and told
them she had seen a ‘’sauger’. “They knew (writes the
lady who recalls this reminiscence of her childhood) the
difference between snakes and their habits, and, boy-like,
wanted to tease me, and said ‘’Twas no ’sauger—it didn’t
have a red ring round its neck, now, did it?’ My heated
imagination saw just such a serpent as soon as their words
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>were spoken, and I declared it had a ring about ‘its neck’.”
In this way she was led on to say that it had scars and
a little bell on its neck, and was soundly rated by her
brothers as a ‘liar’.<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c011'><sup>[183]</sup></a> Here we have a case of “illusion of
memory” induced by suggestion acting on a mind made
preternaturally sensitive by the fear from which it had not
yet recovered. If there was a germ of mendacity in the
case it had its source in the shrinking from the brothers’
ridicule, the wish not to seem utterly ignorant about these
boyish matters, the snakes. Yet who would say that such
swift unseizable movements of feeling in the dim background
of consciousness made the child’s responses lies in
the proper sense of the word?</p>

<p class='c001'>It seems paradoxical, yet is, I believe, indisputable,
that a large part of childish untruth comes upon the scene
in connexion with moral authority and discipline. We
shall see by-and-by that unregenerate child-nature is very
apt to take up the attitude of self-defence towards those
who administer law and inflict punishment. Very little
children brought face to face with restraint and punishment
will ‘try on’ these ruses. Here are one or two
illustrations from the notes on the little girl M. When
seventeen and a half months old she threw down her gloves
when wheeled in her mail-cart by her mother. The latter
picked them up and told her not to throw them away again.
She was at first good, then seemed to deliberate and finally
called out: ‘Mamma, Bubbo’ (dog). The mother turned
to look, and the little imp threw her gloves away again,
laughing; there was of course no dog. The fib about
the dog formed part of a piece of childish make-believe, of
an infantile comedy. It was hardly more when about two
months later, after she had thrown down and broken her
tea-things, and her mother had come up to her, she said:
‘Mamma broke tea-things—beat mamma,’ and proceeded
to beat her. In connexion with such little child-comedies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>there can be no talk of deception. They are the outcome
of the childish instinct to upset the serious attitude of
authority by a bit of fun.</p>

<p class='c001'>The little stratagem begins to look more serious when
the child gets artful enough to put the mother off the scent
by a false statement. For example, a mite of three having
in a moment of temper called her mother ‘monkey,’ and
being questioned as to what she had said, replied: “I said
I was a monkey”. In some cases the child does not wait
to be questioned. A little girl mentioned by Compayré,
being put out by something the mother had done or said,
cried: ‘Nasty!’ (Vilaine!) then after a significant silence,
corrected herself in this wise, ‘Dolly nasty’ (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Poupée
vilaine</span>). The skill with which this transference was
effected without any violence to grammar argues a precocious
art.<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c011'><sup>[184]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Our moral discipline may develop untruth in another
way. When the punishment has been inflicted and the
governor, relenting from the brutal harshness, asks: ‘Are
you sorry?’ or ‘Aren’t you sorry?’ the answer is exceedingly
likely to be ‘No,’ even though this is in a sense untrue.
More clearly is this lying of obstinacy seen where a child
is shut up and kept without food. Asked: ‘Are you
hungry?’ the hardy little sinner stifles his sensations and
pluckily answers ‘No,’ even though the low and dismal
character of the sound shows that the untruth is but a half-hearted
affair.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have tried to show how a child’s untruths may be
more than half “playing,” how when they are serious
assertions they may involve a measure of self-deception,
and how even when consciously false they may have
their origin in excusable circumstances and feelings. In
urging all this I do not wish to deny the statement that
children wall sometimes deliberately invent a lie from a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>base motive, as when a girl of three seeing her little brother
caressed by her mother for some minutes and feeling herself
neglected fabricated the story that ‘Henri’ had been cruel
to the parrot.<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c011'><sup>[185]</sup></a> Yet I am disposed to look on such mean
falsehoods as exceptional if not abnormal.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is much even yet to be done in clearing up the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>modus operandi</i></span> of children’s lies. How quick, for example,
is a child to find out the simple good-natured people, as
the servant-maid, or gardener, who will listen to his
romancing and flatter him by appearing to accept it all as
gospel. More significant is the fact that intentional deception
is apt to show itself towards certain people only.
There is many a school-boy who would think it no dishonour
to say what is untrue to those he dislikes, especially
by way of getting them into hot water, though he would
feel it mean and base to lie to his mother or his father, and
bad form to lie to the head-master. Similar distinctions
show themselves in earlier stages, and are another point of
similarity between the child and the savage whose ideas of
truthfulness seem to be truthfulness for <em>my</em> people only.
This is a side of the subject which would repay fuller
inquiry.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another aspect of the subject which has been but little
investigated is the influence of habit in the domain of lying,
and the formation of persistent permanent lies. The impulse
to stick to an untruth when once uttered is very
human, and in the case of the child is enforced by the fear
of discovery. This applies not only to falsehoods foisted
on persons in authority, but to those by which clever boys
and girls take pleasure in befooling the inferior wits of
others. In this way there grow up in the nursery and in
the playground traditional myths and legends which are
solemnly believed by the simple-minded. Such invention
is in part the outcome of the “pleasures of the imagination”.
Yet it is probable that these are in all cases reinforced not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>only by the wish to produce an effect, but by the love of
power which in the child not endowed with physical prowess
is apt to show itself in hood-winking and practical joking.</p>

<p class='c001'>Closely connected with the permanence of untruths is
the contagiousness of lying. The propagation of falsehood
is apt to be promoted by a certain tremulous admiration for
the hardihood of the lie and by the impulses of the rebel
which never quite slumber even in the case of fairly obedient
children. I suspect, however, that it is in all cases
largely due to the force of suggestion. The falsehood
boldly announced is apt to captivate the mind and hold it
under a kind of spell.</p>

<p class='c001'>This effect of suggestion in generating falsehood is very
marked in those pathological or semi-pathological cases
where children have been led to give false testimony. It
is now known that it is quite possible to provoke an illusion
of memory in certain children between the ages of six and
fifteen by simply affirming something in their hearing,
whether they are in the waking or in the sleeping state,
so that they are ready to state that they actually saw
happen what was asserted.<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c011'><sup>[186]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>So much as to the several manners and circumstances
of childish lying. In order to understand still better
what it amounts to, how much of conscious falsehood
enters into it, we must glance at another and closely related
phenomenon, the pain which sometimes attends
and follows it.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is no doubt that a certain number of children
experience a qualm of conscience when uttering a falsehood.
This is evidenced in the well-known devices by which the
intelligence of the child thinks to mitigate the lie; as when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>on saying what he knows to be false he adds mentally,
‘I do not mean it,’ ‘in my mind,’ or some similar palliative.<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c011'><sup>[187]</sup></a>
Such subterfuges show a measure of sensibility,
for a hardened liar would despise the shifts, and are
curious as illustrations of the childish conscience and its
unlearnt casuistry.</p>

<p class='c001'>The remorse that sometimes follows lying, especially
the first lie, which catches the conscience at its tenderest,
has been remembered by many in later life. Here is a
case. A lady friend remembers that when a child of
four she had to wear a shade over her eyes. One day on
walking out with her mother she was looking, child-wise,
sidewards instead of in front, and nearly struck a lamp-post.
Her mother then scolded her, but presently remembering
the eyes, said: “Poor child, you could not see
well”. She knew that this was not the reason, but she
accepted it, and for long afterwards was tormented with a
sense of having told a lie. Miss Wiltshire, who tells the
story of the mythical snake, gives another recollection
which illustrates the keen suffering of a child when he
becomes fully conscious of falsehood. She was as a small
child very fond of babies, and had been permitted by her
mother to go when invited by her aunt to nurse her baby
cousin. One day wanting much to go when not invited,
she boldly invented, saying that her aunt was busy and
had asked her to spend an hour with the baby. ‘I went
(she adds) not to the baby, but by a circuitous route to
my father’s barn, crept behind one of the great doors,
which I drew as close to me as I could, vainly wishing
that the barn and the hay-stacks would cover me; then
I cried and moaned I do not know how many hours, and
when I went to bed I said my prayers between sobs,
refusing to tell my mother why I wept.’<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c011'><sup>[188]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Such examples of remorse are evidence of a child’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>capability of knowingly stating what is false. This is
strikingly shown in Miss Wiltshire’s two reminiscences;
for she distinctly tells us that in the case of her confident
assertion about the imaginary snake with ring and bell,
she felt no remorse as she was not conscious of uttering a
lie.<a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c011'><sup>[189]</sup></a> But these sufferings of conscience point to something
else, a sense of awful wickedness, of having done violence
to all that is right and holy. How, it may be asked, does
it happen that children feel thus morally crushed after
telling a lie?</p>

<p class='c001'>Here is a question that can only be answered when
we have more material. We know that among all childish
offences lying is the one which is apt to be specially
branded by theological sanctions. The physical torments
with which the ‘lying tongue’ is threatened, may well
beget terror in a timid child’s heart. I think it likely, too,
that the awfulness of lying is thought of by children in its
relation to the all-seeing God who, though he cannot be
lied to, knows when we lie. The inaudible palliative
words added to the lie may be an awkward child-device
for putting the speaker straight with the all-hearing
God.</p>

<p class='c001'>Further inquiry is, however, needed here. Do children
contract a horror of a lie when no religious terrors are
introduced? Is there anything in the workings of a child’s
own mind which would lead him to feel after his first lie as
if the stable world were tumbling about his ears? Let
parents supply us with facts here.</p>

<p class='c001'>Meanwhile I will venture to put forth a conjecture, and
will gladly withdraw it as soon as it is disproved.</p>

<p class='c001'>So far as my inquiries have gone I do not find that
children brought up at home and kept from the contagion
of bad example do uniformly develop a lying propensity.
Several mothers assure me that their children have never
seriously propounded an untruth. I can say the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>about two children who have been especially observed for
the purpose.<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c011'><sup>[190]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This being so, I distinctly challenge the assertion that
lying is instinctive in the sense that a child, even when
brought up among habitual truth tellers, shows an unlearned
aptitude to say what he knows to be false. A child’s quick
imitativeness will, of course, lead him to copy grown-up
people’s untruths at a very early age.<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c011'><sup>[191]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>I will go further and suggest that where a child is
brought up normally, that is, in a habitually truth-speaking
community, he tends, quite apart from moral instruction, to
acquire a respect for truth as what is customary. Consider
for a moment how busily a child’s mind is occupied during
the first years of linguistic performance in getting at the
bottom of words, of fitting ideas to words when trying to
understand others, and words to ideas when trying to
express his own thoughts, and you will see that all this
must serve to make truth, that is, the correspondence of
statement with fact, to the child-mind something matter-of-course,
something not to be questioned, a law wrought
into the very usages of daily life which he never thinks of
disobeying. We can see that children accustomed to truth-speaking
show all the signs of a moral shock when they
are confronted with assertions which, as they see, do not
answer to fact. The child C. was highly indignant on
hearing from his mother that people said what he considered
false things about horses and other matters of interest: and
he was even more indignant at meeting with any such
falsity in one of his books for which he had all a child’s
reverence. The idea of perpetrating a knowing untruth, so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>far as I can judge, is simply awful to a child who has been
thoroughly habituated to the practice of truthful statement.
May it, then, not well be that when a preternatural pressure
of circumstances pushes the child over the boundary line
of truth, he feels a shock, a horror, a giddy and aching
sense of having violated law—law not wholly imposed
by the mother’s command, but rooted in the very habits
of social life? I think the conjecture is well worth considering.</p>

<p class='c001'>Our inquiry has led us to recognise, in the case of
cruelty and of lying alike, that children are by no means
morally perfect, but have tendencies which, if not counteracted
or held in check by others, will develop into true
cruelty and true lying. On the other hand, our study has
shown us that these impulses are not the only ones. A
child has promptings of kindness, which alternate, often in
a capricious-looking way, with those of inconsiderate teasing
and tormenting; and he has, I hold, side by side with the
imaginative and other tendencies which make for untruthful
statement, the instinctive roots of a respect for
truth. These tendencies have not the same relative strength
and frequency of utterance in the case of all children, some
showing, for example, more of the impulse which makes for
truth, others more of the impulse which makes for untruth.
Yet in all children probably both kinds of impulse are
to be observed.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have confined myself to two of the moral traits of
childhood. If there were time to go into an examination
of others, as childish vanity, something similar would, I
think, be found. Children’s vanity, like that of the savage,
has been the theme of more than one chapter, and it is undoubtedly
vast to the point of absurdity. Yet, side by
side with these impulses to deck oneself, to talk boastfully,
there exists a delightful childish candour which, if
not exactly what we call modesty, is possibly something
better.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>We may then, perhaps, draw the conclusion that child-nature
is on its moral side wanting in consistency and
unity. It is a field of half-formed growths, some of which
tend to choke the others. Certain of these are favourable,
others unfavourable to morality. It is for education to see
to it that these isolated propensities be organised into a
system in which those towards the good become supreme
and regulative principles.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>
  <h2 class='c004'>VIII. <br /> UNDER LAW.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c017'><i>The Struggle with Law.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>In the last chapter we tried to get at those tendencies of
child-nature which though they have a certain moral
significance may in a manner be called spontaneous and
independent of the institution of moral training. We will
now examine the child’s attitude towards the moral government
with which he finds himself confronted.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here again we meet with opposite views. Children,
say some, are essentially disobedient and law-breaking.
A child as such is a rebel, delighting in nothing so much
as in evading the rule which he finds imposed on him by
others.</p>

<p class='c001'>The view that children are instinctively obedient and
law-abiding, has not, I think, been very boldly insisted on.
A follower of Rousseau, at least, who sees only clumsy
interference with natural development in our attempts to
govern children, would say that child-nature must resist
the artificial and cramping system which the disciplinarian
imposes.</p>

<p class='c001'>It seems, however, to be allowed by some that a
certain number of children are docile and disposed to
accept authority with its commands. According to these,
children are either obedient or disobedient. This is perhaps
the view of many mothers and pedagogues.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here, too, it is probable that we try to make nature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>too simple. Even the latter view, in spite of its apparent
wish to be discriminating, does not allow for the many-sidedness
of the child, and for the many different ways in
which the instincts of child-nature may vary.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now it is worth asking whether, if the child were
naturally disposed to look on authority as something
wholly hostile, he would get morally trained at all.
Physically mastered and morally cowed he might of course
become; but this is not the same thing as being morally
induced into a habit of accepting law and obeying it.</p>

<p class='c001'>In inquiring into this matter we must begin by drawing
a distinction. There is first the attitude of a child towards
the governor, the parent or other guardian, and there is his
attitude towards law as such. These are by no means the
same thing, and a child of three or four begins to illustrate
the distinction. He may seem to be lawless, opposed to
the very idea of government, when in reality he is merely
objecting to a particular ruler, and the kind of rule (or as
the child would say, misrule) which he is carrying out.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let us look a little into the non-compliant, disobedient
attitude of children. As we have seen, their very liveliness,
the abundance of their vigorous impulses, brings
them into conflict with others’ wills. The ruler, more particularly,
is a great and continual source of crossings and
checkings. The child has his natural wishes and propensities.
He is full of fun, bent on his harmless tricks, and
the mother has to talk seriously to him about being naughty.
How can we wonder at his disliking the constraint? He has
a number of inconvenient, active impulses, such as putting
things in disorder, playing with water, and so forth. As we
all know, he has a duck-like fondness for dirty puddles.
Civilisation, which wills that a child should be nicely dressed
and clean, intervenes in the shape of the nurse and soon
puts a stop to this mode of diversion. The tyro in submission,
if sound in brain and limb, kicks against the restraint,
yells, slaps the nurse, and so forth.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>Such collisions are perfectly normal in the first years of
life. We should not care to see a child give up his inclinations
at another’s bidding without some little show of resistance.
These conflicts are frequent and sharp in proportion
to the sanity and vigour of the child. The best children,
best from a biological point of view, have, I think, most of
the rebel in them. Not infrequently these resistances of
young will to old will are accompanied by more emphatic
protests in the shape of slapping, pushing, and even biting.
The ridiculous inequality in bodily powers, however, saves, or
ought to save, the contest from becoming a serious physical
struggle. The resistance where superior force is used can
only resolve itself into a helpless protest, a vain shrieking or
other utterance of checked and baffled impulse.</p>

<p class='c001'>If instead of physical compulsion authority is asserted
in the shape of a highly disagreeable command, a child,
before obedience has grown into a habit, will be likely to
disobey. If the nurse, instead of pulling the mite away
from the puddle, bids him come away, he may assert himself
in an eloquent ‘I won’t,’ or less bluntly, ‘I can’t come
yet’. If he is very much in love with the puddle, and has
a stout heart, he probably embarks on a tussle of words, in
which ‘I won’t,’ or as the child will significantly put it ‘I
mustn’t,’ is bandied with ‘you must!’ the nurse having at
length to abandon the ‘moral’ method and to resort after
all to physical compulsion.</p>

<p class='c001'>Our sample-child has not, we will assume, yet got so
far as to recognise and defer to a general rule about cleanliness.
Hence it may be said that his opposition is directed
against the nurse as propounding a particular command,
and one which at the moment is excessively unpleasant.
It is as yet not resistance to law as such, but rather to one
specific interference of another will.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the same time we may detect in some of this early
resistance to authority something of the true rebel-nature,
that is to say the love of lawlessness, and what is worse,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>perhaps, the obstinate recklessness of the law-breaker.
The very behaviour of a child when another will crosses
and blocks the line of his activity is suggestive of this.
The yelling and other disorderly proceedings, do not they
speak of the temper of the rioter, of the rowdy? And then,
the fierce persistence in disobedience under rebuke, and the
wild, wicked determination to face everything rather than
obey, are not these marks of an almost Satanic fierceness of
revolt? The thoroughly naughty child sticks at nothing.
Thus a little offender of four when he was reminded by
his sister—two years older—that he would be shut out from
heaven retorted impiously, ‘I don’t care,’ adding: ‘Uncle
won’t go—I’ll stay with him’.<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c011'><sup>[192]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This fierce noisy utterance of the disobedient and law-resisting
temper is eminently impressive. Yet it is not the
only utterance. If we observe children who may be said
to show on the whole an outward submission to authority
we shall discover signs of secret dissatisfaction and antagonism.
The conflict with rule has not wholly ceased: it has
simply changed its manner of proceeding, physical assault
and riotous shouts of defiance being now exchanged for
dialectic attack.</p>

<p class='c001'>A curious chapter in the psychology of the child which
still has to be written is the account of the various devices
by which the astute little novice called upon to wear the
yoke of authority seeks to smooth its chafing asperities.
These devices may, perhaps, be summed up under the head
of “trying it on”.</p>

<p class='c001'>One of the simplest and most obvious of these contrivances
is the extempore invention of an excuse for not
instantly obeying a particular command. A child soon
finds out that to say ‘I won’t’ when he is bidden to do
something is indiscreet as well as vulgar. He wants to
have his own way without resorting to a gross breach of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>good manners, so he replies insinuatingly, ‘I’s very sorry,
but I’s too busy,’ or in some such conciliatory words. This
field of invention offers a fine opportunity for the imaginative
child. A small boy of three years and nine months on
receiving from his nurse the familiar order, “Come here!”
at once replied, “I can’t, nurse, I’s looking for a flea,”
and pretended to be much engrossed in the momentous
business of hunting for this quarry in the blanket of his cot.<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c011'><sup>[193]</sup></a>
The little trickster is such a lover of fun that he is pretty
certain to betray his ruse in a case like this, and our small
flea-catcher, we are told, laughed mischievously as he
proffered his excuse. Such sly fabrications may be just as
naughty as the uninspired excuses of a stupidly sulky child,
but it is hard to be quite as much put out by them.</p>

<p class='c001'>These excuses often show a fine range of inventive
activity. How manifold, for example, are the reasons,
more or less fictitious, which a boy when told to make less
noise is able to urge in favour of non-compliance. Here,
of course, all the great matters of the play-world, the need
of getting his ‘gee-gee’ on, of giving his orders to his soldiers,
and so forth, come in between the prohibition and compliance,
and disobedience in such cases has its excuses.
For to the child his play-world, even though in a manner
modelled on the pattern of our common world, is apart and
sacred; and the conventional restraints as to noise and such
like borrowed from the every-day world seem to him to be
quite out of place in this free and private domain of his
own.</p>

<p class='c001'>We all know the child’s aptness in ‘easing’ the pressure
of commands and prohibitions. If, for example, he is told
to keep perfectly quiet because mother or father wants to
sleep, he will prettily plead for the reservation of whispering
ever so softly. If he is bidden not to ask for things at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>table he will resort to sly indirect reminders of what he
wants, as when a boy of five and a half years whispered
audibly: ‘I hope somebody will offer me some more soup,’
or when a girl of three and a half years, with still greater
childish tact, observed on seeing the elder folk eating cake:
‘I not asking’. This last may be compared with a story
told by Rousseau of a little girl of six years who, having
eaten of all the dishes but one, artfully indicated the fact by
pointing in turn to each of the dishes, saying: ‘I have eaten
that,’ but carefully passing by the untasted one.<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c011'><sup>[194]</sup></a> When
more difficult duties come to be enforced and the neophyte
in the higher morality is bidden to be considerate for others,
and even to sacrifice his own comfort for theirs, he is apt
to manifest a good deal of skill in adjusting the counsel
of perfection to young weakness. Here is an amusing
example. A little boy, Edgar by name, aged five and
three-quarter years, was going out to take tea with some
little girls. His mother, as is usual on such occasions,
primed him with special directions as to behaviour, saying:
“Remember to give way to them like father does to me”.
To which Edgar, after thinking a brief instant, replied:
“Oh, but <em>not</em> all at <em>once</em>. <em>You</em> have to <em>persuade</em> him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A like astuteness will show itself in meeting accusation.
The various ways in which a child will seek to evade the
point in such cases are truly marvellous and show the childish
intelligence at its ablest.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sometimes the dreary talking to, with its well-known
deep accusatory tones, its familiar pleadings, ‘How can you
be so naughty?’ and the rest is daringly ignored. After
keeping up an excellent appearance of listening the little
culprit will proceed in the most artless way to talk about something
more agreeable. This is trying, but is not the worst.
The deepest depth of maternal humiliation is reached when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>a carefully prepared and solemnly delivered homily is rewarded
by a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>tu quoque</i></span> in the shape of a correction of something
in the delivery which offends the child’s sense of propriety.
This befel one mother who, after talking seriously
to her little boy about some fault, was met with this remark:
“Mamma, when you talk you don’t move your upper jaw”.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is of course difficult to say how far a child’s interruptions
and what look like turnings of the conversation when
receiving rebuke are the result of deliberate plotting. We
know it is hard to hold the young thoughts long on any
subject, and the homily makes a heavy demand in this
respect, and its theme is apt to seem dull to a child’s lively
brain. The thoughts will be sure to wander then, and the
rude interruptions and digressions may after all be but the
natural play of the young mind. I fear, however, that design
often has a hand here. The first digression to which
the weak disciplinarian succumbed may have been the result
of a spontaneous flow of childish ideas: but its success enables
the observant child to try it on a second time with
artful aim.</p>

<p class='c001'>In cases in which no attempt is made to ignore the
accusation, the small wits are busy discovering palliatives
and exculpations. Here we have the many ruses, often
crude enough, by which the little culprit tries to shake off
moral responsibility, to deny the authorship of the action
found fault with. The blame is put on anybody or anything.
When he breaks something, say a cup, and is
scolded, he saves himself by saying it was because the cup
was not made strong enough, or because the maid put it
too near the edge of the table. There are clear indications
of fatalistic thought in these childish disclaimers. Things
were so conditioned that he could not help doing what he
did. This fatalism betrays itself in the childish subterfuges
already referred to, by which the ego tries to screen itself
shabbily by throwing responsibility on to the bodily
agents. This device is sometimes hit upon very early.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>A wee child of two when told not to cry gasped out:
"Elsie cry—<em>not</em> Elsie cry—tears cry—naughty tears!"
This, it must be allowed, is more plausible than C.’s lame
attempt to put off responsibility for some naughty action
on his hands. For our tears are in a sense apart from us,
and in the first years are wholly beyond control.</p>

<p class='c001'>The fatalistic form of exculpation meets us later on
under the familiar form, ‘God made me like that’. A
boy of three was blamed for leaving his crusts, and his
conduct contrasted with that of his model papa. Whereupon
he observed with a touch of metaphysical precocity:
“Yes, but, papa, you see God had made you and me
different”.</p>

<p class='c001'>These denials of authorship occur when a charge is
brought home and no clear justification of the action is
forthcoming. In many cases the shrewd intelligence of the
child—which is never so acute as in this art of moral self-defence—discovers
justificatory reasons. In such a case
the attitude is a very different one. It is no longer the
helpless lifting of hands of the irresponsible one, but
the bold steady glance of one who is prepared to defend
his action.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sometimes these justifications are pitiful examples of
quibbling. A boy had been rough with his baby brother.
His mother chid him, telling him he might hurt baby.
He then asked his mother, ‘Isn’t he my own brother?’ and
on his mother admitting so incontestable a proposition,
exclaimed triumphantly, “Well, you said I could do what I
liked with <em>my own</em> things”. The idea of the precious baby
being a boy’s own to do what he likes with is so remote
from older people’s conceptions that it seems impossible
to credit the boy with misunderstanding. We ought, perhaps,
to set him down as a depraved little sophist and destined—but
predictions happily lie outside our <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>métier</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>In some cases these justifications have a dreadful look
of being after-thoughts invented for the express purpose of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>self-protection and knowingly put forward as fibs. Yet
there is need of a wise discrimination here. Take, for
example, the following from the Worcester Collection. A
boy of three was told by his mother to stay and mind his
baby-sister while she went downstairs. On going up again
some time after she met him on the stairs. “Being asked
why he had left the baby he said there was a bumble-bee
in the room and he was afraid he would get stung if he
stayed there. His mother asked him if he wasn’t afraid
his little sister would get stung. He said, ‘Yes,’ but added
that if he stayed in the room the bee might sting them
both, and then she would have two to take care of.” Now
with every wish to be charitable I cannot bring myself to
think that the small boy had really gone through that
subtle process of disinterested calculation before vacating
the room in favour of the bumble-bee, if indeed there was
a bumble-bee. To be caught in the act and questioned is,
I suspect, a situation particularly productive of such specious
fibbing.</p>

<p class='c001'>One other illustration of this keen childish dialectic when
face to face with the accuser deserves to be touched on.
The sharp little wits have something of a lawyer’s quickness
in detecting a flaw in the indictment. Any exaggeration
into which a feeling of indignation happens to betray
the accuser is instantly pounced upon. If, for example, a
child is scolded for pulling kitty’s ears and making her cry
it is enough for the little stickler for accuracy to be able to
say: ‘I wasn’t pulling kitty’s <em>ears</em>, I was only pulling <em>one</em>
of her ears’. This ability to deny the charge in its initial
form gives the child a great advantage, and robs the accusation
in its amended form of much of its sting. Whence,
by the way, one may infer that wisdom in managing
children shows itself in nothing more than in a scrupulous
exactness in the use of words.</p>

<p class='c001'>While there are these isolated attacks on various points
of the daily discipline, we see now and again a bolder line
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>of action in the shape of a general protest against its
severity. Children have been known to urge that the
punishments inflicted on them are ineffectual; and, although
their opinion on such matters is hardly disinterested,
it is sometimes pertinent enough. An American boy aged
five years ten months began to cry because he was forbidden
to go into the yard to play, and was threatened by
his mother with a whipping. Whereupon he observed:
“Well now, mamma, that will only make me cry more”.</p>

<p class='c001'>These childish protests are, as we know, wont to be met
by the commonplaces about the affection which prompts
the correction. But the child finds it hard to swallow
these subtleties. For him love is love, that is caressing,
and doing everything for his present enjoyment; and here
is the mother who says she loves him, and often acts as
if she did, transforming herself into an ogre to torment
him and make him miserable. He may accept her assurance
that she scolds and chastises him because she is a
good mother; only he is apt to wish that she were a shade
less good. A boy of four had one morning to remain in
bed till ten o’clock as a punishment for misbehaviour.
He proceeded to address his mother in this wise: "If I had
any little children I’d be a worse mother than you—I’d
be quite a bad mother; I’d let the children get up directly
I had done my breakfast at any rate". If, on the other
hand, the mother puts forward her own comfort as the
ground of the restraint she may be met by this kind of
thing: “I wish you’d be a little more self-sacrificing and
let me make a noise”.</p>

<p class='c001'>Enough has been said to illustrate the ways in which
the natural child kicks against the imposition of restraints
on his free activity. He begins by showing himself an open
foe to authority. For a long time after, while making a
certain show of submission, he harbours in his breast something
of the rebel’s spirit. He does his best to evade the
most galling parts of the daily discipline, and displays an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>admirable ingenuity in devising excuses for apparent acts
of insubordination. Where candour is permitted he is apt
to prove himself an exceedingly acute critic of the system
which is imposed on him.</p>

<p class='c001'>All this, moreover, seems to show that a child objects
not only to the particular administration under which he
happens to live, but to all law as implying restraints on free
activity. Thus, from the child’s point of view, so far as we
have yet examined it, punishment as such is a thing which
ought not to be.</p>

<p class='c001'>So strong and deep-reaching is this antagonism to law
and its restraints apt to be that the childish longing to be
‘big’ is, I believe, grounded on the expectation of liberty.
To be big seems to the child more than anything else to
be rid of all this imposition of commands, to be able to do
what one likes without interference from others. This
longing may grow intense in the breast of a quite small
child. “Do you know,” asked a little fellow of four years,
“what I shall do when I’m a big man? I’ll go to a shop
and buy a bun and pick out all the currants.” This funny
story is characteristic of the movements of young desire.
The small prohibition not to pick out the currants is one
that may chafe to soreness a child’s sensibility.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><i>On the Side of Law.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>If, however, we look closer we shall find that this hostility
is not the whole, perhaps not the most fundamental part of
the child’s attitude. It is evident, to begin with, that a
good deal of this early criticism of parental government, so
far from implying rejection of all rule, plainly implies its
acceptance. Some of the earliest and bitterest protests
against interference are directed against what looks to the
child irregular or opposed to law. He is allowed, for example,
for some time to use a pair of scissors as a plaything,
and is then suddenly deprived of it, his mother having now
first discovered the unsuitability of the plaything. In such a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>case the passionate outburst and the long bitter protest attest
the sense of injustice, the violation of custom and unwritten
law. Again, the keen resentful opposition of the child to
the look of anything like unfairness and partiality in parental
government shows that he has a jealous feeling of regard for
the universality and the inviolableness of law. Much, too,
of the criticism dealt with above, reveals a fundamental
acknowledgment of law—at least for the purposes of the
argument. Thus the very attempt to establish an excuse, a
justification, may be said to be a tacit admission that if the
action <em>had been</em> done as alleged it would have been naughty
and deserving of punishment. In truth the small person’s
challengings of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>modus operandi</i></span> of his mother’s rule, just
because they are often in a true sense <em>ethical</em>, clearly start
from the assumption of rules, and of the distinction of right
and wrong.</p>

<p class='c001'>This of itself shows that there are in the child compliant
as well as non-compliant tendencies towards law and
towards authority so far as this is lawful. We may now
pass to other parts of a child’s behaviour which help to
make more clear the existence of such law-abiding impulses.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here we may set out with those exhibitions of something
like remorse which often follow disobedience and
punishment in the first tender years. These may, at first,
be little more than physical reactions, due to the exhaustion
of the passionate outbursts. But they soon begin to show
traces of new feelings. A child in disgrace, before he has
a clear moral sense of shame, suffers through a feeling of
estrangement, of loneliness, of self-restriction. If the
habitual relation between mother and child is a loving and
happy one the situation becomes exceedingly painful. The
pride and obstinacy notwithstanding, the culprit feels that
he is cut off from more than one half of his life, that his
beautiful world is laid in ruins. The same little boy who
said: ‘I’d be a worse mother,’ remarked to his mother a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>few months later that if he could say what he liked to God
it would be: ‘Love me when I’m naughty’. I think one
can hardly conceive of a more eloquent testimony to the
suffering of the child in the lonesome, loveless state of
punishment.</p>

<p class='c001'>Is there any analogue of our sense of remorse in this
early suffering? The question of an instinctive moral sense
in children is a perplexing one, and I do not propose to
discuss it now. I would only venture to suggest that in
these poignant griefs of child-life there seem to be signs of
a consciousness of violated instincts. This is, no doubt, in
part the smarting of a loving heart on remembering its unloving
action. But there may be more than this. A child
of four or five is, I conceive, quite capable of reflecting at
such a time that in his fits of naughtiness he has broken
with his normal orderly self, that he has set at defiance that
which he customarily honours and obeys.</p>

<p class='c001'>What, it may be asked, are these instincts? In their
earliest discernible form they seem to me to be respect for
rule, for a regular manner of proceeding as opposed to an
irregular. A child, as I understand the little sphinx, is at
once the subject of ever-changing caprices—whence the
delight in playful defiance of all rule and order—and the
reverer of custom, precedent, rule. And, as I conceive, this
reverence for precedent and rule is the deeper and stronger,
holding full sway in his serious moments.</p>

<p class='c001'>If this view is correct the suffering of naughty children
is not, as has been said by some, wholly the result of the
externals of discipline, punishment, and the loss of the agreeable
things which follow good behaviour, though this is
commonly an element; nor is it merely the sense of loneliness
and lovelessness, though that is probably a large slice
of it; but it contains the germ of something nearer a true
remorse, <i>viz.</i>, a sense of normal feelings and dispositions
set at nought and contradicted.</p>

<p class='c001'>And now we may ask what evidence there is for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>existence of this respect for order and regularity other than
that afforded by the childish protests against apparent inconsistencies
in the administration of discipline.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Walter Bagehot tells us that the great initial
difficulty in the formation of communities was the fixing of
custom. However this be in the case of primitive communities
it seems to me indisputable that in the case of a
child brought up in normal surroundings there is a clearly
observable instinct to fall in with a common mode of
behaviour.</p>

<p class='c001'>This respect for custom is related to the imitative
instincts of the child. He does what he sees others do, and
so tends to fall in with their manner of life. We all know
that these small people take their cue from their elders as
to what is allowable. Hence one difficulty of moral training.
A little boy when two years and one month old had happened
to see his mother tear a piece of calico. The next day he
was discovered to have taken the sheet from the bed and
made a rent in it. When scolded, he replied in his childish
German, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">‘Mamma mach put,’</span> <i>i.e.</i>, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">‘macht caput’</span> (breaks
calico). It is well when the misleading effect of ‘example’
is so little serious as it was in this case.</p>

<p class='c001'>In addition to this effect of others’ doings in making
things allowable in the child’s eyes, there is the binding
influence of a repeated regular manner of proceeding.
This is the might of ‘custom’ in the full sense of the
term, the force which underlies all a child’s conceptions of
‘right’. In spite of the difficulties of moral training, of
drilling children into orderly habits—and I do not lose
sight of these—it may confidently be said that they have
an inbred respect for what is customary, and wears the appearance
of a rule of life. Nor is this, I believe, altogether
a reflexion, by imitation, of others’ orderly ways, and of
the system of rules which is imposed on him by others.
I am quite ready to admit that the institution of social life,
the regular procession of the daily doings of the house, aided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>by the system of parental discipline, has much to do with
fixing the idea of orderliness and regularity in the child’s
mind. Yet I believe the facts point to something more, to
an innate disposition to follow precedent and rule, which
precedes education, and is one of the forces to which
education can appeal. This disposition has its roots in
habit, which is apparently a law of all life: but it is more
than the blind impulse of habit, since it is reflective and
rational, and implies a recognition of the universal.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first crude manifestation of this disposition to make
rule, to rationalise life by subjecting it to a general method,
is seen in those actions which seem little more than the
working of habit, the insistence on the customary lines of
procedure at meals and such like. A mother writes that
her boy when five years old was quite a stickler for
punctilious order in these matters. His cup and spoon
had to be put in precisely the right place, the sequences of
the day, as the lesson before the walk, the walk before bed,
had to be rigorously observed. Any breach of the customary
was apt to be resented as a sort of impiety. This may
be an extreme instance, but my observation leads me to
say that such punctiliousness is not uncommon. What is
more, I have seen it developing itself where the system of
parental government was by no means characterised by
severe insistence on such minutiæ of order. And this would
seem to show that it cannot wholly be set down to the
influences of such government. It seems rather to be a
spontaneous extension of the realm of rule or law.</p>

<p class='c001'>This impulse to extend rule appears more plainly in
many of the little ceremonial observances of the child.
Very charmingly is this respect for rule exhibited in relation
to his animals, dolls and other pets. Not only are
they required to do things in a proper orderly manner,
but people have to treat them with due deference.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“Every night,” writes a mother of her boy aged two years
seven months, "after I have kissed and shaken hands with him, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>have to kiss his ‘boy,’ that is his doll, who sleeps with him, and to
shake its two hands—also to shake the four hoofs of a tiny horse
which lies at the foot of his cot. When all this has been gone
through, he stands up and entreats, ‘More tata, please, more tata,’
<i>i.e.</i>, ‘kiss me again and say more good-nights’. These customs of
his with regard to kissing are peculiar to himself—he kisses his ‘boy’
(doll), also pictures of horses, dogs, cocks and hens, and he puts
his head against us <em>to be kissed</em>; but he will only shake hands and
will not kiss people himself: he reserves his kisses for what he
seems to feel inferior things. We kiss our boy, he kisses his; but
he insists upon being shaken hands with for his part. If other
children come to play he gives them toys, watches them with delight,
tries to give them rides on his ‘go-go’s,’ but does not kiss
them; though he will stroke their hair he does not return their
kisses. It seems to me that he regards it as an action to be
reserved for an inferior thing."</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>I have quoted at length this careful bit of maternal
observation because it seems to indicate so clearly a
spontaneous extension of a custom. The practice of the
mother and father in kissing him was generalised into a
rule of ceremony in the treatment of all inferiors.</p>

<p class='c001'>This subject of childish ceremonial is a curious one, and
deserves a more careful study. It is hardly less interesting
than the origin and survival of adult ceremonial, as elucidated
by Mr. Herbert Spencer. The respect for orderly
procedure on all serious occasions, and especially at church,
is as exacting as that of any savage tribe. <cite>Punch</cite> illustrated
this some years ago by a picture of a little girl asking her
mamma if Mr. So and So was not a very wicked man,
because he didn’t “smell his hat” when he came into his
pew.</p>

<p class='c001'>This jealous regard for ceremony and the proprieties of
behaviour is seen in the enforcement of rules of politeness
by children who will extend them far beyond the scope
intended by the parent. A delightful instance of this fell
under my own observation, as I was walking on Hampstead
Heath. It was a spring day, and the fat buds of
the chestnuts were bursting into magnificent green plumes.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>Two well-dressed ‘misses,’ aged, I should say, about nine
and eleven, were taking their correct morning walk. The
elder called the attention of the younger to one of the trees,
pointing to it. The younger exclaimed in a highly shocked
tone: “Oh, Maud (or was it ‘Mabel’?), you know you
<em>shouldn’t</em> point!” The notion of perpetrating a rudeness
on the chestnut tree was funny enough. But the incident
is instructive as illustrating the childish tendency to stretch
and generalise rules to the utmost.</p>

<p class='c001'>The domain of prayer well illustrates the same tendency.
The child envisages God as a very, very grand person, and
naturally, therefore, extends to him all the courtesies he
knows of. Thus he must be addressed politely with the
due forms ‘Please,’ ‘If you please,’ and so forth. The
German child shrinks from using the familiar form ‘Du’
in his prayers. As one maiden of seven well put it in reply
to a question why she used <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">‘Sie’</span> in her prayers: <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“Ich
werde doch den lieben Gott nicht Du nennen: ich kenne
ihn ja gar nicht”.</span> Again, a child feels that he must not
worry or bore God (children generally find out that some
people look on them as bores), or treat him with any kind
of disrespect. C. objected to his sister’s remaining so long
at her prayers, apparently on the ground that, as God knew
what she had to say, her much talking would be likely to
bore him. An American boy of four on one occasion
refused to say his prayers, explaining, “Why, they’re old.
God has heard them so many times that they are old to
him too. Why, he knows them as well as I do myself.”
On the other hand, God must not be kept waiting. “Oh,
mamma,” said a little boy of three years eight months (the
same that was so insistent about the kissing and hand-shaking),
“how long you have kept me awake for you; God
has been wondering so whenever I was going to say my
prayers.” All the words must be nicely said to him. A
little boy, aged four and three-quarter years, once stopped
in the middle of a prayer and asked his mother: “Oh! how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>do you spell that word?” The question is curious as
suggesting that the child may have envisaged his silent
communications to the far-off King as a letter. In any
case, it showed painstaking and the wish not to offend by
slovenliness of address.</p>

<p class='c001'>Not only do children thus of themselves extend the
scope and empire of rule, they show a disposition to make
rules for themselves. If a child that is told to do a
thing on a single occasion only is found repeating the
action on other occasions, this seems to show the germ of a
law-making impulse. A little boy of two years one month
was once told to give a lot of old toys to the children of
the gardener. Some time after, on receiving some new
toys, he put away his old ones as before for the less
fortunate children. Every careful observer of children
knows that they are apt to proceed this way, to erect
particular actions and suggestions into precedents. This
tendency gives something of the amusing priggishness to
the ways of childhood.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is little doubt, I think, that this respect for
proper orderly behaviour, for precedent and general rule,
forms a vital element in the child’s submission to parental
law. In fixing our attention on occasional acts of disobedience
and lawlessness we are apt to overlook the ease, the
absence of friction with which normal children, if only
decently trained, fall in with the larger part of our observances
and ordinances.</p>

<p class='c001'>That the instinct for order does assist moral discipline
may be seen in the fact that children are apt to pay enormous
deference to our rules. Nothing is more suggestive
here than the talk of children among themselves, the emphasis
they are wont to lay on the ‘must’ and ‘must not’.
The truth is that children have a tremendous belief in law:
a rule is apt to present itself to their imagination as a
thing supremely sacred and awful before which it prostrates
itself.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>This recognition of the absolute imperativeness of a
rule properly laid down by the recognised authority is seen
in children’s jealous insistence on the observance of the rule
in their own case and in that of others. As has been
observed by Preyer a child of two years eight months will
follow out the prohibitions of the mother when he falls into
other hands, sternly protesting, for example, against the
nurse giving him the forbidden knife at table. Very
proper children rather like to instruct their aunts and other
ignorant persons as to the right way of dealing with them,
and will rejoice in the opportunity of setting them right
even when it means a deprivation for themselves. The
self-denying ordinance: ‘Mamma doesn’t let me have many
sweets,’ is by no means beyond the powers of such a child.
One can see here, no doubt, traces of a childish sense of self-importance,
a feeling of the much-waited-on little sovereign
for what befits his supreme worth. Yet, allowing for such
elements, there seems to me to be in this behaviour a residue
of genuine respect for parental law.</p>

<p class='c001'>These carryings out of the parental behest when entrusted
to other hands are instructive as suggesting that the
child feels the constraining force of the command when its
author is no longer present to enforce it. Perhaps a
clearer evidence of respect for the law as such, apart from
its particular enforcement by the parent, is supplied by
children’s way of extending the rules laid down for their
own behaviour to that of others. This point has already
been illustrated in the tendency to universalise the
observances of courtesy and the like. No trait is better
marked in the normal child than the impulse to subject
others to his own disciplinary system. In truth, children
are for the most part particularly alert disciplinarians.
With what amusing severity are they wont to lay down the
law to their dolls, and their animal playmates, subjecting
them to precisely the same prohibitions and punishments as
those to which they themselves are subject! Nor do they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>stop here. They enforce the duties just as courageously on
their human elders. A mite of eighteen months went up
to her elder sister, who was crying, and with perfect mimicry
of the nurse’s corrective manner, said: “Hush! Hush!
papa!” pointing at the same time to the door. The
little girl M. when twenty-two months old was disappointed
because a certain Mr. G. did not call. In the evening she
said: "Mr. D. not did tum—was very naughty, Mr. D. have
to be whipped". So natural and inevitable to the intelligence
of a child does it seem that the system of restraints,
rebukes, punishments under which he lives should have
universal validity.</p>

<p class='c001'>This judicial bent of the child is a curious one and often
develops a priggish fondness for setting others morally
straight. Small boys have to endure much in this way
from the hands of slightly older sisters proficient in
matters of law and delighting to enforce the moralities. But
sometimes the sisters lapse into naughtiness, and then the
small boys have their chance. They too can on such
occasions be priggish if not downright hypocritical. A little
boy had been quarrelling with his sister named Muriel just
before going to bed. When he was undressed he knelt
down to say his prayers, Muriel sitting near and listening.
He prayed (audibly) in this wise: “Please, God, make
Muriel a good girl,” then looked up and said in an angry
voice, “Do you hear that, Muriel?” and after this digression
resumed his petition. I believe fathers when reading family
prayers have been known to apply portions of Scripture in
this personal manner to particular members of the family;
and it is even possible that extempore prayers have been
invented, as by this little prig of a boy, for the purpose of
administering a sort of back-handed corrective blow to an
erring neighbour.</p>

<p class='c001'>This mania for correction shows itself too in relation
to the authorities themselves. A collection of rebukes and
expositions of moral precept supplied by children to their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>erring parents would be amusing and suggestive. As was
illustrated above, a child is especially keen to spy faults
in his governors when they are themselves administering
authority. Here is another example: A boy of two—the
moral instruction of parents by the child begins betimes—would
not go to sleep when bidden to do so by his father
and mother. At length the father, losing patience, addressed
him with a man’s fierce emphasis. This mode of
admonition so far from cowering the child simply offended
his sense of propriety, for he rejoined: “You s’ouldn’t
s’ouldn’t, Assum (<i>i.e.</i>, ‘Arthur,’ the father’s name), you
s’ould speak nicely”.</p>

<p class='c001'>The lengths to which a child with the impulse of moral
correction strong in him will sometimes go, are quite
appalling. One evening a little girl of six had been repeating
the Lord’s prayer. When she had finished, she
looked up and said: ‘I don’t like that prayer, you ought
not to ask for <em>bread</em>, and all that <em>greediness</em>, you ought
only to ask for goodness!’ There is probably in this an
imitative reproduction of something which the child had
been told by her mother, or had overheard. Yet allowing
for this, one cannot but recognise a quite alarming degree
of precocious moral priggishness.</p>

<p class='c001'>We may now turn to what my readers will probably
regard as still clearer evidence of a law-fearing instinct in
children, <i>viz.</i>, their voluntary submission to its commands.
We are apt to think of these little ones as doing right only
under external compulsion. But although a child of four
may be far from attaining to the state of ‘autonomy of
will’ or self-legislation spoken of by the philosopher, he
may show a germ of such free adoption of law. It is possible
that we see the first faint traces of this in a small child’s
way of giving orders to, rebuking, and praising himself.
The little girl M., when only twenty months old, would,
when left by her mother alone in a room, say to herself:
‘Tay dar’ (stay there). About the same time, after being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>naughty and squealing ‘like a railway-whistle,’ she would
after each squeal say in a deep voice, ‘Be dood, Babba’
(her name). At the age of twenty-two months she had
been in the garden and misbehaving by treading on the
box border, so that she had to be carried away by her
mother. After confessing her fault she wanted to go into
the garden again, and promised, ‘Babba will not be
naughty adain’. When she was out she looked at the
box, saying, “If oo (you) do dat I shall have to take oo
in, Babba”. Here, no doubt, we see quaint mimicries
of the external control, but they seem to me to indicate
a movement in the direction of self-control.</p>

<p class='c001'>Very instructive here is the way in which children will
voluntarily come and submit themselves to our discipline.
The little girl M. when less than two years old, would go
to her mother and confess some piece of naughtiness and
suggest the punishment. A little boy aged two years and
four months was deprived of a pencil from Thursday to
Sunday for scribbling on the wall-paper. His punishment
was, however, tempered by permission to draw when taken
downstairs. On Saturday he had finished a picture downstairs
which pleased him. When his nurse fetched him
she wanted to look at the drawing, but the boy strongly
objected, saying: “No Nana (name for nurse) look at it
till Sunday”. And sure enough when Sunday came, and
the pencil was restored to him, he promptly showed nurse
his picture. This is an excellent observation full of suggestion
as to the way in which a child’s mind works. Among
other things it seems to show pretty plainly that the little
fellow looked on the nursery and all its belongings, including
the nurse, during those three days as a place of disgrace
into which the privileges of the artist were not to enter.
He was allowed the indulgence of drawing downstairs,
but he had no right to exhibit his workmanship to the
nurse, who was inseparably associated in his mind with
the forbidden nursery drawing. Thus a process of genuine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>child-thought led to a self-instituted extension of the
punishment.</p>

<p class='c001'>A month later this child "pulled down a picture in the
nursery"—the nursery walls seem to have had a fell attraction
for him—“by standing on a sofa and tugging till the
wire broke. He was alone at the time and very much
frightened though not hurt. He was soothed and told to
leave the picture alone in future, but was not in any way
rebuked. He seemed, however, to think that some punishment
was necessary, for he presently asked whether he was
going to have a certain favourite frock on that afternoon.
He was told ‘No’ (the reason being that the day was wet
or something similar) and he said immediately: ‘’Cause
Neil pulled picture down?’” Here I think we have unmistakable
evidence of an expectation of punishment as
the fit and proper sequel in a case which, though it did
not exactly resemble those already branded by it, was felt
in a vague way to be disorderly and naughty.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such stories of expectation of punishment are capped
by instances of correction actually inflicted by the child
on himself. I believe it is not uncommon for a child when
possessed by a sense of having been naughty to object to
having nice things at table on the ground that previously
on a like occasion he was deprived of them. But the
most curious instance of this moral rigour towards self
which I have met with is the following: A girl of nine had
been naughty, and was very sorry for her misbehaviour.
Shortly after she came to her lesson limping, and remarked
that she felt very uncomfortable. Being asked by her
governess what was the matter with her she said: “It was
very naughty of me to disobey you, so I put my right shoe
on to my left foot and my left shoe on to my right foot”.</p>

<p class='c001'>The facts here briefly illustrated seem to me to show
that there is in the child from the first a rudiment of true
law-abidingness. And this is a force of the greatest consequence
to the disciplinarian. It is something which takes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>side in the child’s breast with the reasonable governor and
the laws which he or she administers. It secures ready
compliance with a large part of the discipline enforced.
When the impulse urging towards licence has been too
strong, and disobedience ensues, this same instinct comes
to the aid of order and good conduct by inflicting pains
which are the beginning of what we call remorse.</p>

<p class='c001'>By-and-by other forces will assist. The affectionate
child will reflect on the misery his disobedience causes his
mother. A boy of four and three-quarter years must, one
supposes, have woke up to this fact when he remarked to
his mother: “Did you choose to be a mother? I think it
must be rather tiresome.” The day when the child first
becomes capable of thus putting himself into his mother’s
place and realising, if only for an instant, the trouble he
has brought on her, is an all-important one in his moral
development.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><i>The Wise Law-giver.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>As our illustrations have suggested, and as every
thoughtful parent knows well enough, the problem of
moral training in the first years is full of difficulty. Yet
our study surely suggests that it is not so hopeless a
problem as we are sometimes weakly disposed to think.
Perhaps a word or two on this may not inappropriately
close this essay.</p>

<p class='c001'>I will readily concede that the difficulty of inculcating
in children a sweet and cheerful obedience arises partly
from their nature. There are trying children, just as there
are trying dogs that howl and make themselves disagreeable
for no discoverable reason but their inherent ‘cussedness’.
There are, I doubt not, conscientious painstaking mothers
who have been baffled by having to manage what appears
to be the utterly unmanageable.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet I think that we ought to be very slow to pronounce
any child unmanageable. I know full well that in the case
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>of these small growing things there are all kinds of hidden
physical commotions which breed caprices, ruffle the temper,
and make them the opposite of docile. The peevish child
who will do nothing, will listen to no suggestion, is assuredly
a difficult subject to deal with. But such moodiness and
cross-grainedness springing from bodily disturbances will
be allowed for by the discerning mother, who will be too
wise to bring the severer measures of discipline to bear on
a child when subject to their malign influence. Waiving
these disturbing factors, however, I should say that a good
part, certainly more than one half, of the difficulty of training
children is due to our clumsy bungling modes of going
to work.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sensible persons know that there is a good and a bad
way of approaching a child. The wrong ways of trying to
constrain children are, alas, numerous. I am not writing
an ‘advice to parents,’ and am not called on therefore to
deal with the much-disputed question of the rightness and
wrongness of corporal punishment. Slaps may be needful
in the early stages, even though they do lead to little tussles.
A mother assures me that these battles with her several
children have all fallen between the ages of sixteen months
and two years. It is, however, conceivable that such fights
might be avoided altogether; yet a man should be chary
of dogmatising on this delicate matter.</p>

<p class='c001'>What is beyond doubt is that the slovenly discipline—if
indeed discipline it is to be called—which consists in
alternations of gushing fondness with almost savage severity,
or fits of government and restraint interpolated between
long periods of neglect and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>laisser faire</i></span>, is precisely what
develops the rebellious and law-resisting propensities. But
discipline can be bad without being a stupid pretence.
Everything in the shape of inconsistency, saying one thing
at one time, another thing at another, or treating one child
in one fashion, another in another, tends to undermine the
pillars of authority. Young eyes are quick to note these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>little contradictions, and they sorely resent them. It is
astonishing how careless disciplinarians can show themselves
before these astute little critics. It is the commonest
thing to tell a child to behave like his elders, forgetting that
this, if indeed a rule at all, can only be one of very limited
application. Here is a suggestive example of the effect of
this sort of teaching sent me by a mother. “At three and
a half, when some visitors were present, she was told not
to talk at dinner-time. ‘Why me no talk? Papa talks.’
‘Yes, but papa is grown up, and you are only a little girl;
you can’t do just like grown-up people.’ She was silent for
some time, but when I told her ten minutes later to sit
nicely with her hands in her lap like her cousins, she
replied, with a very humorous smile, ‘Me tan’t (can’t) sit
like grown-up people, me is only a little girl’.”</p>

<p class='c001'>We can fail and make children disloyal instead of loyal
subjects by unduly magnifying our office, by insisting too
much on our authority. Children who are over-ruled, who
have no taste of being left unmolested and free to do what
they like, can hardly be expected to submit graciously.
Another way of carrying parental control to excess is by
exacting displays of virtue which are beyond the moral
capabilities of the child. A lady sends me this reminiscence
of her childhood. She had been promised sixpence when
she could play her scales without fault, and succeeded in
the exploit on her sixth birthday. The sixpence was given
to her, but soon after her mother suggested that she should
spend the money in fruit to give to her (the mother’s) invalid
friend. This was offending the sense of justice, for if the
child is jealous of anything as his very own it is surely the
reward he has earned; and was, moreover, a foolish attempt
to call forth generosity where generosity was wholly out of
place. An even worse example is that recorded by Ruskin.
When a child he was expected to come down to dessert and
crack nuts for the grand older folk while peremptorily forbidden
to eat any. Such refined cruelties of government
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>deserve to be defeated in their objects. Much of our ill
success in governing children would probably turn out to be
attributable to unwisdom in assigning tasks, and more particularly
in making exactions which wound that sensitive
fibre of a child’s heart, the sense of justice.</p>

<p class='c001'>Parents are, I fear, apt to forget that generosity and the
other liberal virtues owe their worth to their spontaneity.
They may be suggested and encouraged but cannot be
exacted. On the other hand, a parent cannot be more
foolish than to discourage a spontaneous outgoing of good
impulse, as if nothing were good but what emanated from
a spirit of obedience. In a pretty and touching little American
work, <cite>Beckonings from Little Hands</cite>, the writer describes
the remorse of a father who, after his child’s death, recalled
the little fellow’s first crude endeavour to help him by
bringing fuel, an endeavour which, alas! he had met with
something like a rebuff.</p>

<p class='c001'>The right method of training, which develops and
strengthens by bracing exercise the instinct of obedience,
cannot easily be summarised; for it is the outcome of the
highest wisdom. I may, however, be permitted to indicate
one or two of its main features.</p>

<p class='c001'>Informed at the outset by a fine moral feeling and a
practical tact as to what ought to be expected, the wise
mother is concerned before everything to make her laws
appear as much a matter of course as the daily sequences
of the home life, as unquestionable axioms of behaviour;
and this not by a foolish vehemence of inculcation but by a
quiet skilful inweaving of them into the order of the child’s
world. To expect the right thing, as though the wrong
thing were an impossibility, rather than to be always pointing
out the wrong thing and threatening consequences; to
make all her words and all her own actions support this
view of the inevitableness of law; to meet any indications of a
disobedient spirit, first with misunderstanding, and later with
amazement; this is surely the first and fundamental matter.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>The effectiveness of this discipline depends on the
simple psychological principle that difficult actions tend to
realise themselves in the measure in which the ideas of them
become clear and persistent. Get a child steadily to follow
out in thought an act to which he is disinclined and you
have more than half mastered the disinclination. The
quiet daily insistence of the wise rule of the nursery proceeds
by setting up and maintaining the ideas of dutiful
actions, and so excluding the thought of disobedient
actions.</p>

<p class='c001'>It has recently been pointed out that in this moral control
of the child through suggestion of right actions we have
something closely analogous to the action of suggestion
upon the hypnotised subject. The mother, the right sort of
mother, has on the child’s mind something of the subduing
influence of the Nancy doctor: she induces ideas of
particular actions, gives them force and persistence so that
the young mind is possessed by them and they work themselves
out into fulfilment as occasion arises.</p>

<p class='c001'>In order that this effect of ‘obsession,’ or a full occupation
of consciousness with the right idea, may result, certain
precautions are necessary. As observant parents know, a
child may be led by a prohibition to do the very thing he is
bidden not to do. We have seen how readily a child’s mind
moves from an affirmation to a corresponding negation, and
conversely. The ‘contradictoriness’ of a child, his passion
for saying the opposite of what you say, shows the same odd
manner of working of the young mind. Wanting to do
what he is told not to do is another effect of this “contrary
suggestion,” as it has been called, aided of course by the
child’s dislike of all constraint.<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c011'><sup>[195]</sup></a> If we want to avoid this
effect of suggestion and to secure the direct effect, we must
first of all acquire the difficult secret of personal influence, of
the masterfulness which does not repel but attracts; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>secondly try to reduce our forbiddings with their contrary
suggestions to a minimum.</p>

<p class='c001'>The action in moral training of this influence of a quasi-hypnotic
suggestion becomes more clearly marked when
difficulties occur; when some outbreak of wilful resistance
has to be recognised and met, or some new and relatively
arduous feat of obedience has to be initiated.
Here I find that intelligent mothers have found their way
to methods closely resembling those of the hypnotist.
“When R. is naughty and in a passion (writes a lady friend
of her child aged three and a half), I need only suggest
to him that he is some one else, say a friend of his, and he
will take it up at once, he will pretend to be the other
child, and at last go and call himself, now a good boy,
back again.” This mode of suggestion, by helping the
‘higher self’ to detach itself from and control the lower might,
one suspects, be much more widely employed in the moral
training of children. Suggestion may work through the
emotions. Merely to say, ‘Mother would like you to do
this,’ is to set up an idea in the child’s consciousness
by help of the sustaining force of his affection. “If (writes
a lady) there was anything Lyle particularly wished not to
do, his mother had only to say, ‘Dobbin (a sort of canonised
toy-horse already referred to) would like you to
do this,’ and it was done without a murmur.”</p>

<p class='c001'>We have another analogue to hypnotic suggestion where
a mother prepares her child some time beforehand for a
difficult duty, telling him that she expects him to perform
it. A mother writes that her boy, when about the age of
two and a half years more particularly, was inclined to
burst into loud but short fits of crying. “I have found
(she says) these often checked by telling him beforehand
what would be expected of him, and exacting a promise
that he would do the thing cheerfully. I have seen his
face flush up ready to cry when he remembered his promise
and controlled himself.” This reminds one forcibly of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>the commands suggested by the hypnotiser to be carried
into effect when the subject wakes. Much more, perhaps,
might be done in this direction by choosing the right
moments for setting up the persistent ideas in the child’s
consciousness. I know a lady who got into the way of
giving moral exhortation to her somewhat headstrong girl
at night before the child fell asleep, and found this very
effectual. It is possible that we may be able to apply this
idea of preparatory and premunitory suggestion in new and
surprising ways to difficult and refractory children.<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c011'><sup>[196]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>One other way in which the wise mother will win the
child over to duty is by developing his consciousness of
freedom and power. A mother, who was herself a well-known
writer for children, has recorded in some notes on her
children that when one of her little girls had declined to
accede to her wish she used to say to her: ‘Oh, yes, I think
when you have remembered how pleasant it is to oblige
others you will do it’. ‘I will think about it, mamma,’
the child would reply, laughing, and then go and hide her
head behind a sofa-pillow which she called her ‘thinking
corner’. In half a minute she would come out and say:
“Oh, yes, mamma, I have thought about it and I will do it”.
This strikes me as an admirable combination of regulative
suggestion with exercise of the young will in moral decision.
It gave the child the consciousness of using her own will,
and yet maintained the needed measure of guidance and
control.</p>

<p class='c001'>As the moral consciousness develops and new problems
arise, new openings for such suggestive guidance will offer
themselves. How valuable, for example, is the mother’s
encouragement of the weakly child, shrinking from a difficult
self-repressive action, when she says with inspiring voice:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>‘You <em>can</em> do it if you try’. Thus pilot-like she conducts
the little navigator out into the open main of duty where he
will have to steer himself.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have tried to show that the moral training of children
is not beyond human powers. It has its strong supports
in child-nature, and these, when there are wisdom and
method on the ruler’s side, will secure success. I have not
said that the trainer’s task is easy. So far from thinking
this, I hold that a mother who bravely faces the problem,
neither abandoning the wayward will to its own devices,
nor, hardly less weakly, handing over the task of disciplining
it to a paid substitute, and who by well-considered
and steadfast effort succeeds in approaching the perfection
I have hinted at, combining the wise ruler with the tender
and companionable parent, is among the few members of
our species who are entitled to its reverence.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>IX. <br /> THE CHILD AS ARTIST.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>One of the most interesting, perhaps also one of the most
instructive, phases of child-life is the beginnings of art-activity.
This has been recognised by one of the best-known
workers in the field of child-psychology, M. Bernard Perez,
who has treated the subject in an interesting monograph.<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c011'><sup>[197]</sup></a>
This department of our subject will, like that of language,
be found to have interesting points of contact with the
phenomena of primitive race-culture.</p>

<p class='c001'>The art-impulse of children lends itself particularly well
to observation. No doubt, as we shall see, there are difficulties
for the observer here. It may sometimes be a fine
point to determine whether a childish action properly
falls under the head of genuine art-production, though
I do not think that this is a serious difficulty. On the
other hand, the art-impulse where it exists manifests itself
directly, and for the most part in so characteristic an
objective form that we are able to study its features with
special facility.</p>

<p class='c001'>In its narrow sense as a specialised instinct prompting
its possessor to follow a definite line of production, as
drawing of the artistic sort, or simple musical composition,
the art-impulse is a particularly variable phenomenon of
childhood. Some children, who afterwards take seriously
to a branch of art-culture, manifest an innate bent by a
precocious devotion to this line of activity. Many others,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>I have reason to believe, have a passing fondness for a
particular form of art-activity. On the other hand, there
are many children who display almost a complete lack, not
only of the productive impulse, but of the æsthetic sense of
the artist. So uncertain, so sporadic are these appearances
of a rudimentary art among children that one might be
easily led to think that art-activity ought not to be reckoned
among their common characteristics.</p>

<p class='c001'>To judge so, however, would be to judge erroneously by
applying grown-up standards. It is commonly recognised
that art and play are closely connected. It is probable
that the first crude art of the race, or at least certain directions
of it, sprang out of play-like activities, and however
this be the likenesses of the two are indisputable. I shall
hope to bring these out in the present study. This being
so, we are, I conceive, justified in speaking of art-impulses
as a common characteristic of childhood.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although we shall find many interesting points of analogy
between crude child-art and primitive race-art, we must not,
as pointed out above, expect a perfect parallelism. In some
directions, as drawing, concerted dancing, the superior experience,
strength and skill of the adult will reveal themselves,
placing child-art at a considerable disadvantage in the
comparison. Contrariwise, the intervention of the educator’s
hand tends seriously to modify the course of development
of the child’s æsthetic aptitudes. His tastes get acted upon
from the first and biassed in the direction of adult tastes.</p>

<p class='c001'>This modifying influence of education shows itself more
especially in one particular. There is reason to think that
in the development of the race the growth of a feeling
for what is beautiful was a concomitant of the growth of
the art-impulse, the impulse to adorn the person, to collect
feathers and other pretty things. Not so in the case of the
child. Here we note a certain growth of the liking for pretty
things before the spontaneous art-impulse has had time to
manifest itself. Most children who have a cultivated mother
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>or other guardian acquire a rudimentary appreciation of what
their elders think beautiful before they do much in the way
of art-production. We provide them with toys, pictures,
we sing to them and perhaps we even take them to the
theatre, and so do our best to inoculate them with our ideas
as to what is pretty. Hence the difficulty—probably the
chief difficulty—of finding out what the child-mind, left to
itself, does prefer. At the same time the early date at which
such æsthetic preferences begin to manifest themselves makes
it desirable to study them before we go on to consider the
active side of child-art. We will try as well as we can to
extricate the first manifestations of genuine childish taste.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><i>First Responses to Natural Beauty.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>At the very beginning, before the educational influence
has had time to work, we can catch some of the characteristics
of this childish quasi-æsthetic feeling. The directions
of a child’s observation, and of the movements of his
grasping arms, tell us pretty clearly what sort of things
attract and please him.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the home scene it is bright objects, such as the fire-flame,
the lamp, the play of the sunlight on a bit of glass
or a gilded frame; out-of-doors, glistening water, a meadow
whitened by daisies, the fresh show mantle, later the moon
and the stars, which seem to impart to the dawning consciousness
the first hint of the world’s beauty. Luminosity,
brightness in its higher intensities, whether the bright rays
reach the eye directly or are reflected from a lustrous surface,
this makes the first gladness of the eye as it remains
a chief source of the gladness of life.</p>

<p class='c001'>The feeling for colour as such comes distinctly later.
The first delight in coloured objects is hardly distinguishable
from the primordial delight in brightness. This applies pretty
manifestly to the brightly illumined, rose-red curtain which
Preyer’s boy greeted with signs of satisfaction at the age of
twenty-three days, and it applies to later manifestations.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>Thus Preyer found on experimenting with his boy towards
the end of the second year as to his colour-discrimination
that a decided preference was shown for the bright or
luminous colours, red and yellow.<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c011'><sup>[198]</sup></a> Much the same thing
was observed by Miss Shinn in her interesting account of
the early development of her niece’s colour-sense.<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c011'><sup>[199]</sup></a> Thus in
the twenty-eighth month she showed a special fondness for
the daffodils, the bright tints of which allured another and
older maiden, and, alas! to the place whence all brightness
was banished. About the same time the child conceived a
fondness for a yellow gown of her aunt, strongly objecting
to the substitution for it of a brown dress. Among the
other coloured objects which captivated the eye of this little
girl were a patch of white cherry blossom, and a red sun-set
sky. Such observations might easily be multiplied. Whiteness,
it is to be noted, comes, as we might expect, with
bright partial colours, among the first favourites.<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c011'><sup>[200]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>At what age a child begins to appreciate the value of
colour as colour, to like blue or red, for its own sake and
apart from its brightness, it is hard to say. The experiments
of Preyer, Binet, Baldwin, and others, as to the discrimination
of colour, are hardly conclusive as to special likings,
though Baldwin’s plan of getting the child to reach out for
colours throws a certain light on this point. According to
Baldwin blue is one of the first colours to be singled out;
but he does not tell us how the colours he used (which did
not, unfortunately, include yellow—the child’s favourite
according to other observers) were related in point of
luminosity.<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c011'><sup>[201]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>No doubt a child of three or four is apt to conceive a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>special liking for a particular colour which favourite he
is wont to appropriate as ‘my colour’. A collection of
such perfectly spontaneous preferences is a desideratum in
the study of the first manifestations of a feeling for colour.
Care must be taken in observing these selections to eliminate
the effects of association, and the unintentional influence
of example and authority, as when a child takes to a
particular colour because it is ‘mamma’s colour,’ that is,
the one she appears to affect in her dress and otherwise.</p>

<p class='c001'>The values of the several colours probably disclose themselves
in close connexion with that of colour-contrast. Many
of the likings of a child of three in the matter of flowers,
birds, dresses, and so on, are clearly traceable to a growing
pleasure in colour-contrast. Here again we must distinguish
between a true chromatic and a merely luminous effect.
The dark blue sky showing itself in a break in the white
clouds, one of the coloured spectacles which delighted Miss
Shinn’s niece, may have owed much of its attractiveness to
the contrast of light and dark. It would be interesting to
experiment with children of three with a view to determine
whether and how far chromatic contrast pleases when it
stands alone, and is not supported by that of chiaroscuro.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have reason to believe that children, like the less cultivated
adults, prefer juxtapositions of colours which lie far
from one another in the colour-circle, as blue and red or blue
and yellow. It is sometimes said that the practice and the
history of painting show blue and red to be a more pleasing
combination than that of the complementary colours,
blue and yellow. It would be well to test children’s feeling
on this matter. It would be necessary in this inquiry to see
that the child did not select for combination a particular
colour as blue or yellow for its own sake, and independently
of its relation to its companion—a point not very easy to
determine. Care would have to be taken to eliminate
further the influence of authority as operating, not only by
instructing the child what combinations are best, but by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>setting models of combination, in the habitual arrangements
of dress and so forth. This too would probably prove to
be a condition not easy to satisfy.<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c011'><sup>[202]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>I have dwelt at some length on the first germs of colour-appreciation,
because this is the one feature of the child’s
æsthetic sense which has so far lent itself to definite experimental
investigation. It is very different when we turn
to the first appreciation of form. That little children have
their likings in the matter of form, is, I think, indisputable,
but they are not those of the cultivated adult. A quite
small child will admire the arch of a rainbow, and the roundness
of a kitten’s form, though in these instances the delight
in form is far from pure. More clearly marked is the
appreciation of pretty graceful movements, as a kitten’s
boundings. Perhaps the first waking up to the graces of
form takes place in connexion with this delight in the
forms of motion, a delight which at first is a mixed feeling,
involving the interest in all motion as suggestive of life, to
which reference has already been made. Do not all of us,
indeed, tend to translate our impressions of still forms back
into these first impressions of the forms of motion?</p>

<p class='c001'>One noticeable feature in the child’s first response to the
attractions of form is the preference given to ‘tiny’ things.
The liking for small natural forms, birds, insects, shells, and
so forth, and the prominence of such epithets as ‘wee,’
‘tiny’ or ‘teeny,’ ‘dear little,’ in the child’s vocabulary alike
illustrate this early direction of taste. This feeling again
is a mixed one; for the child’s interest in very small fragile-looking
things has in it an element of caressing tenderness
which again contains a touch of fellow-feeling. This is
but one illustration of the general rule of æsthetic development
in the case of the individual and of the race alike
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>that a pure contemplative delight in the aspect of things
only gradually detaches itself from a mixed feeling.</p>

<p class='c001'>If now we turn to the higher aspects of form, regularity
of outline, symmetry, proportion, we encounter a difficulty.
Many children acquire while quite young and before any
formal education commences a certain feeling for regularity
and symmetry. But is this the result of a mere observation
of natural or other forms? Here the circumstances of the
child become important. He lives among those who insist
on these features in the daily activities of the home. In
laying the cloth of the dinner-table, for example, a child
sees the regular division of space enforced as a law. Every
time he is dressed, or sees his mother dress, he has an
object-lesson in symmetrical arrangement. And so these
features take on a kind of ethical rightness before they are
judged as elements of æsthetic value. As to a sense of
proportion between the dimensions or parts of a form, the
reflexion that this involves a degree of intellectuality above
the reach of many an adult might suggest that it is not
to be expected from a small child; and this conjecture
will be borne out when we come to examine children’s
first essays in drawing.</p>

<p class='c001'>These elementary pleasures of light, colour, and certain
simple aspects of form, may be said to be the basis of a
crude perception of beauty in natural objects and in the
products of human workmanship. A quite small child is
capable of acquiring a real admiration for a beautiful lady,
in the appreciation of which brightness, colour, grace of
movement, the splendour of dress, all have their part,
while the charm for the eye is often reinforced by a sweet
and winsome quality of voice. Such an admiration is not
perfectly æsthetic: awe, an inkling of the social dignity of
dress,<a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c011'><sup>[203]</sup></a> perhaps a longing to be embraced by the charmer,
may all enter into it; yet a genuine admiration of look for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>its own sake is the core of the feeling. In other childish
admirations, as the girl’s enthusiastic worship of the newly
arrived baby, we see a true æsthetic sentiment mingled with
and struggling, so to speak, to extricate itself from such
‘interested’ feelings as sense of personal enrichment by the
new possession and of family pride. In the likings for
animals, again, which often take what seem to us capricious
and quaint directions, we may see rudiments of æsthetic
perceptions half hidden under a lively sense of absolute
lordship tempered with affection.</p>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps the nearest approach to a pure æsthetic enjoyment
in these first experiences is the love of flowers. The
wee round wonders with their mystery of velvety colour
are well fitted to take captive the young eye. I believe
most children who live among flowers and have access to
them acquire something of this sentiment, a sentiment of
admiration for beautiful things with which a sort of dumb
childish sympathy commonly blends. No doubt there are
marked differences among children here. There are some
who care only, or mainly, for their scent, and the strong
sensibilities of the olfactory organ appear to have a good
deal to do with early preferences and prejudices in the
matter of flowers.<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c011'><sup>[204]</sup></a> Others again care for them mainly as a
means of personal adornment, though I am disposed to think
that this partially interested fondness is less common with
children than with many adults. It is sometimes said that
the love of flowers is, in the main, a characteristic of girls.
I think however that if one takes children early enough,
before a consciousness of sex and of its proprieties has been
allowed to develop under education, the difference will be
but slight. Little boys of four or thereabouts often show a
very lively sentiment of admiration for these gems of the
plant world.</p>

<p class='c001'>In much of this first crude utterance of the æsthetic
sense of the child we have points of contact with the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>manifestations of taste in the race. Delight in bright
glistening things, in gay tints, in strong contrasts of colour,
as well as in certain forms of movement, as that of feathers—the
favourite personal adornment—this is known to be
characteristic of the savage and gives to his taste in the
eyes of civilised man the look of childishness. On the other
hand it is doubtful whether the savage attains to the sentiment
of the child for the beauty of flowers. Our civilised
surroundings, meadows and gardens, as well as the constant
action of the educative forces of example, soon carry the
child beyond the savage in this particular.</p>

<p class='c001'>How far can children be said to have the germ of a
feeling for nature, or, to use the more comprehensive modern
term, cosmic emotion? It is a matter of common observation
that they have not the power to embrace a multitude of
things in a single act of contemplation. Hence they have
no feeling for landscape as a harmonious complex of
picturesquely varied parts. When they are taken to see a
‘view’ their eye instead of trying to embrace the whole, as
a fond parent desires, provokingly pounces on some single
feature of interest, and often one of but little æsthetic value.
People make a great mistake in taking children to ‘points
of view’ under the supposition that they will share in
grown people’s impressions. Perez relates that some
children taken to the Pic du Midi found their chief pleasure
in scrambling up the peak and saying that they were on
donkeys.<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c011'><sup>[205]</sup></a> Mere magnitude or vastness of spectacle does
not appeal to the child, for a sense of the sublime grows out
of a complex imaginative process which is beyond his
young powers. So far as immensity affects him at all,
as in the case of the sea, it seems to excite a measure of
dread in face of the unknown; and this feeling, though
having a certain kinship with the emotion of sublimity, is
distinct from this last. It has nothing of the joyous consciousness
of expansion which enters into the later feeling.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>It is only to certain limited objects and features of nature
that the child is æsthetically responsive. He knows the
loveliness of the gilded spring meadow, the fascination of
the sunlit stream, the awful mystery of the wood, and
something too perhaps of the calming beauty of the broad
blue sky. That is to say, he has a number of small rootlets
which when they grow together will develop into a feeling
for nature.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here, too, the analogy between the child and the
uncultured nature-man is evident. The savage has no
æsthetic sentiment for nature as a whole, though he may
feel the charm of some of her single features, a stream,
a mountain, the star-spangled sky, and may even be
affected by some of the awful aspects of her changing
physiognomy. Are we not told, indeed, that a true
æsthetic appreciation of the picturesque variety of nature’s
scenes of the weird charm of wild places, and of the
sublime fascinations of the awful and repellent mountain,
are quite late attainments in the history of our race?<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c011'><sup>[206]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'><i>Early Attitude towards Art.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>We may now look at the child’s attitude towards those
objects and processes of human art which from the first form
part of his environment and make an educative appeal to
his senses; and here we may begin with those simple musical
effects which follow up certain impressions derived from
the natural world.</p>

<p class='c001'>It has been pointed out that sounds form a chief source
of the little child-heart’s first trepidations. Yet this prolific
cause of disquietude, when once the first alarming effect
of strangeness has passed, becomes a main source of interest
and delight. Some of nature’s sounds, as those of running
water, and of the wind, early catch the ear, and excite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>wonder and curiosity. Miss Shinn illustrates fully in the
case of her niece how the interest in sounds developed
itself in the first years.<a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c011'><sup>[207]</sup></a> This pleasure in listening to
sounds and in tracing them to their origin forms a chief
pastime of babyhood.</p>

<p class='c001'>Æsthetic pleasure in sound begins to be differentiated
out of this general interest as soon as there arises a comparison
of qualities and a development of preferences.
Thus the sound of metal (when struck) is preferred to that
of wood or stone. A nascent feeling for musical quality
thus emerges which probably has its part in many of the
first likings for persons; certain pitches, as those of the
female voice, and possibly timbres being preferred to others.</p>

<p class='c001'>Quite as soon, at least, as this feeling for quality of
sound or tone, there manifests itself a crude liking for
rhythmic sequence. It is commonly recognised that our
pleasure in regularly recurring sounds is instinctive, being
the result of our whole nervous organisation. We can
better adapt successive acts of listening when sounds
follow at regular intervals, and the movements which
sounds evoke can be much better carried out in a regular
sequence. The infant shows us this in his well-known
liking for well-marked rhythms in tunes which he accompanies
with suitable movements of the arms, head, etc.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first likings for musical composition are based on
this instinctive feeling for rhythm. It is the simple tunes,
with well-marked easily recognisable time-divisions, which
first take the child’s fancy, and he knows the quieting and
the exciting qualities of different rhythms and times.
Where rhythm is less marked, or grows highly complex,
the motor responses being confused, the pleasurable
interest declines. It is the same with the rhythmic
qualities of verses. The jingling rhythms which their souls
love are of simple structure, with short feet well marked
off, as in the favourite, ‘Jack and Gill’.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>Coming now to art as representative we find that a
child’s æsthetic appreciation waits on the growth of intelligence,
on the understanding of artistic representation as contrasted
with a direct presentation of reality.</p>

<p class='c001'>The development of an understanding of visual representation
or the imaging of things has already been touched
upon. As Perez points out, the first lesson in this branch
of knowledge is supplied by the reflexions of the mirror,
which, as we have seen, the infant begins to take for
realities, though he soon comes to understand that they are
not tangible realities. The looking-glass is the best means
of elucidating the representative function of the image
or ‘Bild’ just because it presents this image in close
proximity to the reality, and so invites direct comparison
with this.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the case of pictures where this direct comparison is
excluded we might expect a less rapid recognition of the
representative function. Yet children show very early that
picture-semblances are understood in the sense that they call
forth reactions similar to those called forth by realities. A
little boy was observed to talk to pictures at the end of the
eighth month. This perhaps hardly amounted to recognition.
Pollock says that the significance of pictures “was in
a general way understood” by his little girl at the age of
thirteen months.<a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c011'><sup>[208]</sup></a> Miss Shinn tells us that her niece, at
the age of forty-two weeks, showed the same excitement at
the sight of a life-size painting of a cat as at that of real
cats.<a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c011'><sup>[209]</sup></a> Ten months is also given me by a lady as the date
at which her little boy recognised pictures of animals by
naming them ‘bow-wow,’ etc., without being prompted.</p>

<p class='c001'>This early recognition of pictures is certainly remarkable
even when we remember that animals have the germ of it.
The stories of recognition by birds of paintings of birds,
and by dogs of portraits of persons, have to do with fairly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>large and finished paintings.<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c011'><sup>[210]</sup></a> A child, however, will ‘recognise’
a small and roughly executed drawing. He seems
in this respect to surpass the powers of savages, some of
whom, at least, are said to be slow in recognising pictorial
semblances. This power, which includes a delicate observation
of form and an acute sense of likeness, is seen most
strikingly in the recognition of individual portraits. Miss
Shinn’s niece in her fourteenth month picked out her father’s
face in a group of nine, the face being scarcely more than
a quarter of an inch in diameter.<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c011'><sup>[211]</sup></a> I noticed the same fineness
of recognition in my own children.</p>

<p class='c001'>One point in this early observation of pictures is curious
enough to call for especial remark. A friend of mine, a
psychologist, writes to me that his little girl, aged three
and a half, “does not mind whether she looks at a picture
the right way up or the wrong; she points out what you
ask for, eyes, feet, hands, tail, etc., about equally well
whichever way up the picture is, and never asks to have
it put right that she may see it better”. The same thing
was noticed in the other children of the family, and the
mother tells me that her mother observed it in her children.
I have found a further illustration of this indifference to the
position of a picture in the two children of another friend
of mine. Professor Petrie tells me that he once watched
an Arab boy looking at a picture-book. One, a drawing of
horses and chariot, happened to have a different position
from the rest, so that the book being held as before, the
horses seemed to be going upwards; but the boy was not
in the least incommoded, and without attempting to turn
the book round easily made it out. These facts are curious
as illustrating the skill of the young eye in deciphering.
They may possibly have a further significance as showing
how what we call position—the arrangement of a form in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>relation to a vertical line—is a comparatively artificial view
of which a child as yet takes little if any account. He
may be able to concentrate his attention so well on form
proper that he is indifferent to the point how the form is
placed. Yet this matter is one which well deserves further
investigation.<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c011'><sup>[212]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>A further question arises as to whether this ‘recognition’
of pictures by children towards the end of the first year
necessarily implies a grasp of the idea of a picture, that is,
of a representation or copy of something. The first reactions
of a child, smiling, etc., on seeing mirror-images
and pictures, do not seem to show this, but merely that
he is affected much as he would be by the presence of
the real object, or, at most, that he recognises the picture
as a kind of thing. The same is, I think, true of the so-called
recognition of pictures by animals.</p>

<p class='c001'>That children do not, at first, seize the pictorial or
representative function is seen in the familiar fact that they
will touch pictures as they touch shadows and otherwise
treat them as if they were tangible realities. Thus Pollock’s
little girl attempted to smell at the trees in a picture and
‘pretended’ to feed some pictorial dogs.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the first clear apprehension of the pictorial function
is reached, it is difficult to say. Miss Shinn thought that
her niece “understood the purport of a picture quite well” at
the age of forty-five weeks. She draws this conclusion from
the fact that at this date the child in answer to the question
‘Where are the flowers?’ leaned over and touched the painted
flowers on her aunt’s gown, and then looked out to the garden
with a cry of desire.<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c011'><sup>[213]</sup></a> But this inference seems to me very
risky. All that the child’s behaviour proves is that she
‘classed’ real and painted flowers together, while she recognised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>the superiority of the former as the tangible and
probably the odorous ones. The strongest evidence of
recognition of pictorial function by children is, I think,
their ability to recognise the portrait of an individual. But
even this is not quite satisfactory. It is conceivable, at least,
that a child may look on a photograph of his father as a
kind of ‘double’. The boy C. took his projected photograph
very seriously as a kind of doubling of himself. The story
of the dog, a Dandy Dinmont terrier, that trembled and
barked at a portrait of his dead mistress<a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c011'><sup>[214]</sup></a> seems to me to
bear this out. It would surely be rather absurd to say that
the demonstrations of this animal, whatever they may have
meant, prove that he took the portrait to be a memento-likeness
of his dead mistress.</p>

<p class='c001'>We are apt to forget how difficult and abstract a conception
is that of pictorial representation, how hard it is to
look at a thing as pure semblance having no value in itself,
but only as standing for something else. A like slowness
on the part of the child to grasp a sign, as such, shows itself
here as in the case of verbal symbols. Children will, quite
late, especially when feeling is aroused and imagination
specially active, show a disposition to transform the semblance
into the thing. Miss Shinn herself points out that
her niece, who seems to have been decidedly quick, was as
late as the twenty-fifth month touched with pity by a picture
of a lamb caught in a thicket, and tried to lift the painted
branch that lay across the lamb. In her thirty-fifth month,
again, when looking at a picture of a chamois defending her
little one from an eagle, “she asked anxiously if the mamma
would drive the eagle away, and presently quite simply
and unconsciously placed her little hand edgewise on the
picture so as to make a fence between the eagle and the
chamois”.<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c011'><sup>[215]</sup></a> Such ready confusion of pictures with realities
shows itself in the fourth year and later. A boy nearly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>five was observed to strike at the figures in a picture
and to exclaim: “I can’t break them”. The Worcester
Collection of observations illustrates the first confused idea
of a picture. “One day F., a boy of four, called on a friend,
Mrs. C., who had just received a picture, representing a
scene in winter, in which people were going to church, some
on foot and others in sleighs. F. was told whither they
were going. The next day he came and noticed the picture,
and looking at Mrs. C. and then at the picture said:
‘Why, Mrs. C., them people haven’t got there yet, have
they?’”</p>

<p class='c001'>All this points, I think, to a slow and gradual emergence
of the idea of representation or likeness. If a child is capable
in moments of intense imagination of confusing his battered
doll with a living reality, he may be expected to act similarly
with respect to the fuller likeness of a picture. Vividness of
imagination tends in the child as in the savage, and indeed
in all of us, to invest a semblance with something of
reality. We are able to control the illusory tendency and
to keep it within the limits of an æsthetic semi-illusion; not
so the child. Is it too fanciful to suppose that the belief of
the savage in the occasional visits of the real spirit-god
to his idol has for its psychological motive the impulse
which prompts the child ever and again to identify his
toys and even his pictures with the realities which they
represent?</p>

<p class='c001'>As might be expected this impulse to confuse representation
and represented reality shows itself very distinctly
in the first reception of dramatic spectacle. If you dress
up as Father Christmas, your child, even though he is told
that you are his father, will hardly be able to resist the
illusion that your disguise so powerfully induces. Cuvier
relates that a boy of ten on watching a stage scene in
which troops were drawn up for action, broke out in loud
protestations to the actor who was taking the part of the
general, telling him that the artillery was wrongly placed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>and so forth.<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c011'><sup>[216]</sup></a> This reminds one of the story of the sailors
who on a visit to a theatre happened to see a representation
of a mutiny on board ship, and were so excited that they
rushed on the stage and took sides with the authorities in
quelling the movement.</p>

<p class='c001'>I believe that this same tendency to take art-representations
for realities reappears in children’s mental attitude
towards stories. A story by its narrative form seems to
tell of real events, and children, as we all know, are wont
to believe tenaciously that their stories are true. I think I
have observed a disposition in imaginative children to go
beyond this, and to give present actuality to the scenes and
events described. And this is little to be wondered at
when one remembers that even grown people, familiar with
the devices of art-imitation, tend now and again to fall into
this confusion. Only a few days ago, as I was reading an
account by a friend of mine of a perilous passage in an
Alpine ascent, accomplished years ago, I suddenly caught
myself in the attitude of proposing to shout out to stop
him from venturing farther. A vivid imaginative realisation
of the situation had made it for the moment a present
actuality.</p>

<p class='c001'>Careful observations of the first attitudes of the child-mind
towards representative art are greatly needed. We
should probably find considerable diversity of behaviour.
The presence of a true art-feeling would be indicated by
a special quickness in the apprehension of art-semblance as
such.</p>

<p class='c001'>In these first reactions of the young mind to the stimulus
of art-presentation we may study other aspects of the
æsthetic aptitude. Very quaint and interesting is the
exacting realism of these first appreciations. A child is
apt to insist on a perfect detailed reproduction of the
familiar reality. And here one may often trace the fine
observation of these early years. Listen, for example, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>the talk of the little critic before a drawing of a horse or a
railway train, and you will be surprised to find how closely
and minutely he has studied the forms of things. It is the
same with other modes of art-representation. Perez gives
an amusing instance of a boy, aged four, who when taken
to a play was shocked at the anomaly of a chamber-maid
touching glasses with her master on a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>fête</i></span> day. “In our
home,” exclaimed the stickler for regularities, to the great
amusement of the neighbours, “we don’t let the nurse drink
like that.”<a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c011'><sup>[217]</sup></a> It is the same with story. Children are liable
to be morally hurt if anything is described greatly at
variance with the daily custom. Æsthetic rightness is as
yet confused with moral rightness or social propriety,
which, as we have seen, has its instinctive support in the
child’s mind in respect for custom.</p>

<p class='c001'>Careful observation will disclose in these first frankly
expressed impressions the special directions of childish
taste. The preferences of a boy of four in the matter of
picture-books tell us where his special interests lie, what
things he finds pretty, and how much of a genuine æsthetic
faculty he is likely to develop later on. Here, again, there
is ample room for more careful studies directed to the
detection of the first manifestations of a pure delight in
things as beautiful, as charming at once the senses and
the imagination.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first appearances of that complex interest in life
and personality which fills so large a place in our æsthetic
pleasures can be best noted in the behaviour of the child’s
mind towards dramatic spectacle and story. The awful
ecstatic delight with which a child is apt to greet any
moving semblance carrying with it the look of life and
action is something which some of us, like Goethe, can
recall among our oldest memories. The old-fashioned
moving <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">‘Schatten-bilder,’</span> for which the gaudy but rigid
pictures of the magic lantern are but a poor substitute, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>puppet-show, with what a delicious wonder have these
filled the childish heart. And as to the entrancing,
enthralling delight of the story—well Thackeray and others
have tried to describe this for us.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of very special interest in these early manifestations of
a feeling for art is the appearance of a crude form of the
two emotions to which all representations of life and character
make appeal—the feeling for the comic, and for the tragic
side of things. What we may call the adults fallacy, the
tendency to judge children by grown-up standards, frequently
shows itself in an expectation that their laughter
will follow the directions of our own. I remember having
made the mistake of putting those delightful books, <cite>Tom
Sawyer</cite> and <cite>Huckleberry Finn</cite>, into the hands of a small
boy with a considerable sense of fun, and having been
humiliated at discovering that there was no response.
Children’s fun is of a very elemental character. They are
mostly tickled, I suspect, by the spectacle of some upsetting
of the proprieties, some confusion of the established
distinctions of rank. Dress, as we have seen, has an
enormous symbolic value for the child’s mind, and any
confusion here is apt to be specially laughter-provoking.
One child between three and four was convulsed at the
sight of his baby bib fastened round the neck of his bearded
sire. There is, too, a considerable element of rowdiness
in children’s sense of the comical, as may be seen by the
enduring popularity of the spectacle of Punch’s successful
misdemeanours and bravings of the legal authority.</p>

<p class='c001'>Since children are apt to take spectacles with an exacting
seriousness, it becomes interesting to note how the two
moods, realistic stickling for correctness, and rollicking
hilarity at the sight of the disorderly, behave in relation
one to another. More facts are needed on this point. It
is probable that we have here to do in part with a permanent
difference of temperament. There are serious matter-of-fact
little minds which are shocked by a kind of spectacle or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>narrative that would give boundless delight to a more elastic
fun-loving spirit. But discarding these permanent differences
of disposition, I think that in general the sense of fun, the
delight in the topsy-turviness of things, is apt to develop
later than the serious realistic attitude already referred to.
Here, too, it is probable that the evolution of the individual
follows that of the race: the solemnities of custom and
ritual weigh so heavily at first on the savage-mind that
there is no chance for sprightly laughter to show himself.
However this be, most young children appear to be unable
to appreciate true comedy where the incongruous co-exists
with and takes on one half of its charm from serious
surroundings. Their laughter is best called forth by a
broadly farcical show in which all serious rules are set at
nought.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of no less interest in this attitude of the child-mind
towards the representations by art of human character and
action are the first rude manifestations of the feeling for the
tragic side of life. A child of four or six is far from realising
the divine necessity which controls our mortal lives. Yet
he will display a certain crude feeling for thrilling situation,
exciting adventure, and something, too, of a sympathetic
interest in the woes of mortals, quadrupeds as well as bipeds.
The action, the situation, may easily grow too painful for
an imaginative child disposed to take all representative
spectacle as reality: yet the absorbing interest of the action
where the sadness is bearable attests the early development
of that universal feeling for the sorrowful fatefulness of
things which runs through all imaginative writings from the
‘penny dreadful’ upwards.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><i>Beginnings of Art-production.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>We have been trying to catch the first faint manifestations
of æsthetic feeling in children’s contemplative attitude
towards natural objects and the presentations of art. We
may now pass to what is a still more interesting department of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>childish æsthetics, their first rude attempts at art-production.
We are wont to say that children are artists in embryo,
that in their play and their whole activity they manifest the
germs of the art-impulse. In order to see whether this idea
is correct we must start with a clear idea of what we mean
by art-activity.</p>

<p class='c001'>I would define art-activity as including all childish
doings which are consciously directed to an external result
recognised as beautiful, as directly pleasing to sense and
imagination. Thus a gesture, or an intonation of voice,
which is motived by a feeling for what is ‘pretty’ or ‘nice’
is a mode of art-activity as much as the production of a
more permanent æsthetic object, as a drawing.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now if we look at children’s activity we shall find that
though much of it implies a certain germ of æsthetic feeling
it is not pure art-activity. In the love of personal adornment,
for example, we see, as in the case of savages, the
æsthetic motive subordinated to another and personal or
interested feeling, vanity or love of admiration. On the other
hand, in children’s play, which undoubtedly has a kinship
with art, we find the æsthetic motive, the desire to produce
something beautiful, very much in the background. We
have then to examine these primitive forms of activity so
as to try to disengage the genuine art-element.</p>

<p class='c001'>One of the most interesting of these early quasi-artistic
lines of activity is that of personal adornment. The impulse
to maintain appearances appears to reach far down in animal
life. The animal’s care of its person is supported by two
instincts, the impulse to frighten or overawe others, and
especially those who are, or are likely to be, enemies,
illustrated in the raising of feathers and hair so as to increase
size; and the impulse to attract, which probably
underlies the habit of trimming feathers and fur among
birds and quadrupeds. These same impulses are said to
lie at the root of the elaborate art of personal adornment
developed by savages. The anthropologist divides such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>ornament into alluring and alarming, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">‘Reizschmuck’</span> and
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">‘Schreckschmuck’</span>.<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c011'><sup>[218]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In the case of children’s attention to personal appearance
there is no question of tracing out the workings of a
pure instinct. The care of the person is before all other
things inculcated and enforced by others, and forms, indeed,
a main branch of the nursery training. To a mother, as
is perfectly natural, a child is apt to present himself as the
brightest of the household ornaments, which has to be kept
neat and spotless with even greater care than the polished
table and other pretty things. This early drilling is likely
to be unpleasant. Many children resent at first not only
soap and water and the merciless comb, but even arrayings
in new finery. Adornment is forced on the child before
the instinct has had time to develop itself, and the manner
of the adornment does not always accommodate itself to the
natural inclinations of the childish eye. Hence the familiar
fact that with children the care of personal appearance when
it is developed takes on the air of a respect for law. It is
more than half a moral feeling, a readiness to be shocked at
a breach of a custom enforced from the first by example and
precept.</p>

<p class='c001'>Again, the instinct of adornment in the child is often
opposed by other impulses. I have already touched on a
small child’s feeling of uneasiness at seeing his mother in
new apparel. A like apprehensiveness shows itself in
relation to his own dress. Many little children show a
marked dislike to new raiment. As I have remarked
above, a change of dress probably disturbs and confuses
their sense of personality.</p>

<p class='c001'>In spite, however, of these and other complicating
circumstances I believe that the instinct to adorn the person
is observable in children. They like a bit of finery in the
shape of a string of beads or of daisies for the neck, a
feather for the hat, a scrap of brilliantly coloured ribbon or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>cloth as a bow for the dress, and so forth. Imitation,
doubtless, plays a part here, but it is, I think, possible to
allow for this, and still to detect points of contact with the
savage’s love of finery. Perhaps, indeed, we may discern
the play of both the impulses underlying personal ornament
which were referred to above, <i>viz.</i>, the alluring and
alarming. Allowing for the differences of intelligence, of
sexual development and so forth, we may say that children
betray a rudiment of the instinct to win admiration by
decorating the person, and also of the instinct to overawe.
A small boy’s delight in adding to his height and formidable
appearance by donning his father’s tall hat is pretty
certainly an illustration of this last.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is not the place to inquire whether the love of
finery in children—a very variable trait, as M. Perez and
others have shown—is wholly the outcome of vanity. I
would, however, just remark that a child lost in the vision
of himself reflected in a mirror decked out in new apparel
may be very far from feeling vanity as we understand the
word. The pure child-wonder at what is new and
mysterious may at such a moment overpower other
feelings, and make the whole mental condition one of
dream-like trance.</p>

<p class='c001'>Since children are left so little free to deck themselves,
it is of course hard to study the development of æsthetic
taste in this domain of art-like activity. Yet the quaint
attempts of the child to improve his appearance throw an
interesting light on his æsthetic preferences. He is at
heart as much a lover of glitter, of gaudy colour, as his
savage prototype. With this general crudity of taste,
individual differences soon begin to show themselves, a
child developing a marked bent, now to modest neatness
and refinement, now to gaudy display, and this, it may be,
in direct opposition to the whole trend of home influence.<a id='r219' /><a href='#f219' class='c011'><sup>[219]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>Another and closely connected domain of activity
which is akin to art is the manifestation of grace and
charm in action. Much of the beauty of movement, of
gesture, of intonation, in a young child may be unconscious,
and as much a result of happy physical conditions
as the pretty gambols of a kitten. Yet one may commonly
detect in graceful children the rudiment of an æsthetic
feeling for what is nice, and also of the instinct to please.
There is, indeed, in these first actions and manners, into
which stupid conventionality has not yet imported all kinds
of awkward restraints, as when the little girl M. would kiss
her hand spontaneously to other babies as she passed them
in the street, something of the simple grace and dignity of
the more amiable savages. Now a feeling for what is graceful
in movement, carriage, speech and so forth is no clear
proof of a specialised artistic impulse: yet it attests the
existence of a rudimentary appreciation of what is beautiful,
as also of an impulse to produce this.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the forms of childish activity just referred to we
have to do with mixed impulses in which the true art-element
is very imperfectly represented. There is a liking
for pretty effect, and an effort to realise it, only the effect
is not prized wholly for its own sake, but partly as a means
of winning the smile of approval. The true art-impulse
is characterised by the love of shaping beautiful things for
their own sake, by an absorbing devotion to the process
of creation, into which there enters no thought of any
advantage to self, and almost as little of benefiting others.
Now there is one field of children’s activity which is marked
by just this absorption of thought and aim, and that is play.</p>

<p class='c001'>To say that play is art-like has almost become a commonplace.
Any one can see that when children are at play
they are carried away by pleasurable activity, are thinking
of no useful result but only of the pleasure of the action
itself. They build their sand castles, they pretend to keep
shop, to entertain visitors, and so forth, for the sake of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>enjoyment which they find in these actions. This clearly
involves one point of kinship with the artist, for the poet
sings and the painter paints because they love to do so.
It is evident, moreover, from what was said above on the
imaginative side of play that it has this further circumstance
in common with art-production, that it is the bodying
forth of a mental image into the semblance of outward
life. Not only so, play exhibits the distinction between
imitation and invention—the realistic and the idealistic
tendency in art—and in its forms comes surprisingly near
representing the chief branches of art-activity. It thus fully
deserves to be studied as a domain in which we may look
for early traces of children’s artistic tendencies.</p>

<p class='c001'>If by play we understand all that spontaneous activity
which is wholly sustained by its own pleasurableness, we
shall find the germ of it in those aimless movements and
sounds which are the natural expression of a child’s joyous
life. Such outpourings of happiness have a quasi-æsthetic
character in so far as they follow the rhythmic law of all
action. Where the play becomes social activity, that is,
the concerted action of a number, we get something closely
analogous to those primitive harmonious co-ordinations of
movements and sounds in which the first crude music, poetry
and dramatic action of the race are supposed to have had
their common origin.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such naïve play-activity acquires a greater æsthetic importance
when it becomes significant or representative of
something: and this direction appears very early in child-history.
The impulse to imitate the action of another seems
to be developed before the completion of the first half-year.<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c011'><sup>[220]</sup></a>
In its first crude form, as reproducing a gesture or sound
uttered at the moment by another, it enters into the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>of social or concerted play. A number of children find the
harmonious performance of a series of dance or other movements,
such as those of the kindergarten games, natural and
easy, because the impulse to imitate, to follow another’s lead,
at once prompts them and keeps them from going far astray.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is a higher and more intellectual kind of imitation when
a child recalls the idea of something he has seen done and
reproduces the action. This is often carried out under the
suggestive force of objects which happen to present themselves
at the time, as when a child sees an empty cup and
pretends to drink, or a book and simulates the action of
reading out of it, or a pair of scissors and proceeds to
execute snipping movements. In other cases the imitation
is more spontaneous, as when a child recalls and repeats
some funny saying that he has heard.</p>

<p class='c001'>This imitative action grows little by little more complex,
and in this way a prolonged make-believe action may be
carried out. Here, it is evident, we get something closely
analogous to histrionic performance. A child pantomimically
representing some funny action comes, indeed, very
near to the mimetic art of the comedian.</p>

<p class='c001'>Meanwhile, another form of imitation is developing, <i>viz.</i>,
the production of semblances in things. Early illustrations
of this impulse are the making of a river out of the gravy in
the plate, the pinching of pellets of bread till they take on
something of resemblance to known forms. One child, three
years old, once occupied himself at table by turning his
plate into a clock, in which his knife (or spoon) and fork
were made to act as hands, and cherry stones put round
the plate to represent the hours. Such table-pastimes are
known to all observers of children, and have been prettily
touched on by R. L. Stevenson.<a id='r221' /><a href='#f221' class='c011'><sup>[221]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Such formative touches are, at first, rough enough, the
transformation being effected, as we have seen, much
more by the alchemy of the child’s imagination than by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>the cunning of his hands. Yet, crude as it is, and showing
at first almost as much of chance as of design, it is a manifestation
of the same plastic impulse, the same striving to
produce images or semblances of things, which possesses
the sculptor and the painter. In each case we see a mind
dominated by an idea and labouring to give it outward
embodiment. The more elaborate constructive play which
follows, the building with sand and with bricks, with which
we may take the first spontaneous drawings, are the direct
descendant of this rude formative activity. The kindergarten
occupations, most of all the clay-modelling, make direct
appeal to this half-artistic plastic impulse in the child.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this imitative play we see from the first the tendency
to set forth what is characteristic in the things represented.
Thus in the acting of the nursery the nurse, the coachman
and so forth are given by one or two broad touches, such
as the presence of the medicine-bottle or its semblance, or
of the whip, together, perhaps, with some characteristic
manner of speaking. In this way child-play, like primitive
art, shows a certain unconscious selectiveness. It presents
what is constant and typical, imperfectly enough no doubt.
The same selection of broadly distinctive traits is seen where
some individual seems to be represented. There is a precisely
similar tendency to a somewhat bald typicalness of outline
in the first rude attempts of children to form semblances.
This will be fully illustrated presently when we examine
their manner of drawing.</p>

<p class='c001'>As observation widens and grows finer, the first bald
abstract representation becomes fuller and more life-like.
A larger number of distinctive traits is taken up into the
representation. Thus the coachman’s talk becomes richer,
fuller of reminiscences of the stable, etc., and so colour is
given to the dramatic picture. A precisely similar process
of development is noticeable in the plastic activities. The
first raw attempt to represent house or castle is improved
upon, and the image grows fuller of characteristic detail and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>more life-like. Here, again, we may note the parallelism
between the evolution of play-activity and of primitive
art.</p>

<p class='c001'>This movement away from bare symbolic indication to
concrete pictorial representation involves a tendency to
individualise, to make the play or the shapen semblance
life-like in the sense of representing an individual reality.
Such individual concreteness may be obtained by a
mechanical reproduction of some particular action and scene
of real life, and children in their play not infrequently
attempt a faithful recital or portraiture of this kind. Such
close unyielding imitation shows itself, too, now and again
in the attempt to act out a story. Yet with bright fanciful
children the impulse to give full life and colour to the
performance rarely stops here. Fresh individual life is best
obtained by the aid of invention, by the intervention of
which some new scene or situation, some new grouping of
personalities is realised. Nothing is æsthetically of more
interest in children’s play than the first cautious intrusion
into the domain of imitative representation of this impulse
of invention, this desire for the new and fresh as distinct
from the old and customary. Perhaps, too, there is no side
of children’s play in which individual differences are more
clearly marked or more significant than this. The child of
bold inventive fancy is shocking to his companion whose
whole idea of proper play is a servile imitation of the scenes
and actions of real life. Yet the former will probably be found
to have more of the stuff of which the artist is compacted.</p>

<p class='c001'>All such invention, moreover, since it aims at securing
some more vivacious and stirring play-experience, naturally
comes under the influence of the childish instinct of exaggeration.
I mean by this the untaught art of vivifying and
strengthening a description or representation by adding
touch to touch. In the representations of play, this love of
colour, of strong effect, shows itself now in a piling up of
the beautiful, gorgeous, or wonderful, as when trying to act
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>some favourite scene from fairy-story, or some grand social
function, now in a bringing together of droll or pathetic
incidents so as to strengthen the comic or the tragic feeling
of the play-action. In all this—which has its counterpart
in the first crude attempts of the art of the race to break
the tight bonds of a servile imitation—we have, I believe,
the germ of what in our more highly developed art we call
the idealising impulse.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have, perhaps, said enough to show that children’s
play is in many respects analogous to art of the simpler
kind, also that it includes within itself lines of activity which
represent the chief directions of art-development.<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c011'><sup>[222]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Yet though art-like this play is not fully art. In play a
child is too self-centred, if I may so say. The scenes he
acts out, the semblances he shapes with his hands, are not
produced as having objective value, but rather as providing
himself with a new environment. The peculiarity of all
imaginative play, its puzzle for older people, is its contented
privacy. The idea of a child playing as an actor is said to
‘play’ in order to delight others is a contradiction in terms.
As I have remarked above, the pleasure of a child in what we
call ‘dramatic’ make-believe is wholly independent of any
appreciating eye. “I remember,” writes R. L. Stevenson,
“as though it were yesterday, the expansion of spirit, the
dignity and self-reliance, that came with a pair of mustachios
in burnt cork <em>even when there was none to see</em>.”<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c011'><sup>[223]</sup></a> The
same thing is true of concerted play. A number of children
playing at being Indians, or what not, do not ‘perform’ <em>for</em>
one another. The words ‘perform,’ ‘act’ and so forth all
seem to be out of place here. What really occurs in this
case is a conjoint vision of a new world, a conjoint imaginative
realisation of a new life.</p>

<p class='c001'>This difference between play and art is sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>pushed to the point of saying that art has its root in the
social impulse, the wish to please.<a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c011'><sup>[224]</sup></a> This I think is simplifying
too much. Art is no doubt a social phenomenon, as
Guyau and others have shown. It has been well said that
"an individual art—in the strictest sense—even if it were
conceivable is nowhere discoverable".<a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c011'><sup>[225]</sup></a> That is to say the
artist is constituted as such by a participation in the common
consciousness, the life of his community, and his creative
impulse is controlled and directed by a sense of common or
objective values. Yet to say that art is born of the instinct
to please or attract is to miss much of its significance. The
ever-renewed contention of artists, ‘art for art’s sake,’ points
to the fact that they, at least, recognise in their art-activity
something spontaneous, something of the nature of self-expression,
self-realisation, and akin to the child’s play.</p>

<p class='c001'>May we not say, then, that the impulse of the artist has its
roots in the happy semi-conscious activity of the child at
play, the all-engrossing effort to ‘utter,’ that is, give outer
form and life to an inner idea, and that the play-impulse
becomes the art-impulse (supposing it is strong enough to
survive the play-years) when it is illumined by a growing
participation in the social consciousness, and a sense of the
common worth of things, when, in other words, it becomes
conscious of itself as a power of shaping semblances which
shall have value for other eyes or ears, and shall bring
recognition and renown? Or, to put it somewhat differently,
may we not say that art has its twin-rootlets in the two
directions of childish activity which we have considered,
<i>viz.</i>, the desire to please so far as this expresses itself in
dress, graceful action, and so forth, and the entrancing isolating
impulse of play? However we express the relation,
I feel sure that we must account for the origin of art by
some reference to play. A study of the art of savages, more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>especially perhaps of the representations of fighting and
hunting in their pantomime-dances, seems to show that art
is continuous with play-activity.</p>

<p class='c001'>To insist on this organic connexion between play and
art is not to say that every lively player is fitted to become
an art-aspirant. The artistic ambition implies too rare a
complex of conditions for us to be able to predict its
appearance in this way. It may, however, be thrown out
as a suggestion to the investigator of the first manifestations
of artistic genius that he might do well to cast his eye on
the field of imaginative play. It will possibly be found that
although not a romping riotous player, nor indeed much
disposed to join other children in their pastimes, the original
child has his own distinctive style of play, which marks him
out as having more than other children of that impulse to
dream of far-off things, and to bring them near in the
illusion of outer semblance, which enters more or less
distinctly into all art.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have left myself no space to speak of the child’s first
attempts at art as we understand it. Some of this art-activity,
more particularly the earliest weaving of stories,
is characteristic enough to deserve a special study. I have
made a small collection of early stories, and some of them
are interesting enough to quote. Here is a quaint example
of the first halting manner of a child of two and a half
years as invention tries to get away from the sway of
models: “Three little bears went out a walk and they
found a stick, and they poked the fire with it, and they
poked the fire and then went a walk”. Soon, however, the
young fancy is apt to wax bolder, and then we get some
fine invention. A boy of five years and a quarter living at
the sea-side improvised as follows. He related “that one
day he went out on the sea in a lifeboat when suddenly he
saw a big whale, and so he jumped down to catch it, but
it was so big that he climbed on it and rode on it in the
water, and all the little fishes laughed so”.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>With this comic story may be compared a more serious
not to say tragic one from the lips of a girl one month
younger, and characterised by an almost equal fondness
for the wonderful. “A man wanted to go to heaven before
he died. He said, ‘I don’t want to die, and I must see
heaven!’ Jesus Christ said he must be patient like other
people. He then got <em>so</em> angry, and screamed out as loud
as he could, and kicked up his heels as high as he could,
and they (the heels) went into the sky, and the sky fell
down and broke earth all to pieces. He wanted Jesus
Christ to mend the earth again, but he wouldn’t, so this was
a good punishment for him.” This last, which is the work
of one now grown into womanhood and no longer a story-teller,
is interesting in many ways. The wish to go to
heaven without dying is, as I know, a motive derived from
child-life. The manifestations of displeasure could, one
supposes, only have been written by one who was herself
experienced in the ways of childish ‘tantrums’. The
naïve conception of sky and earth, and lastly the moral
issue of the story, are no less instructive.</p>

<p class='c001'>These samples may serve to show that in the stories of by
no means highly-gifted children we come face to face with
interesting traits of the young mind, and can study some of
the characteristic tendencies of early and primitive art.<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c011'><sup>[226]</sup></a> Of
the later efforts to imitate older art, as verse writing, the
same cannot, I think, be said. Children’s verses so far as
I have come across them are poor and stilted, showing all
the signs of the cramping effect of models and rules to which
the child-mind cannot easily accommodate itself, and wanting
all true childish inspiration. No doubt, even in these
choking circumstances, childish feeling may now and again
peep out. The first prose compositions, letters before all if
they may be counted art, give more scope for the expression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>of a child’s feeling and the characteristic movements of his
thought, and might well repay study.<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c011'><sup>[227]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>There is one other department of this child-art which
clearly does deserve to be studied with some care—drawing.
And this for the very good reason that it is not wholly a
product of our influence and education, but shows itself in
its essential characteristics as a spontaneous self-taught
activity of childhood which takes its rise, indeed, in the
play-impulse. This will be the subject of the next essay.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>X. <br /> THE YOUNG DRAUGHTSMAN.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c017'><i>First Attempts to Draw.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>A child’s first attempts at drawing are pre-artistic and a
kind of play, an outcome of the instinctive love of finding
and producing semblances of things illustrated in the last
essay. Sitting at the table and covering a sheet of paper
with line-scribble he is wholly self-centred, ‘amusing himself,’
as we say, and caring nothing about the production of “objective
values”.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet even in the early stages of infantile drawing the
social element of art is suggested in the impulse of the
small draughtsman to make his lines indicative of something
to others’ eyes, as when he bids his mother look at
the ‘man,’ ‘gee-gee,’ or what else he fancies that he has
delineated.<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c011'><sup>[228]</sup></a> And this, though crude enough and apt to
shock the æsthetic sense of the matured artist by its unsightliness,
is closely related to art, forming, indeed, in a
manner a preliminary stage of pictorial design.</p>

<p class='c001'>We shall therefore study children’s drawings as a kind
of rude embryonic art. In doing this our special aim will
be to describe and explain childish characteristics. This,
again, will compel us to go to some extent into the early
forms of observation and imagination. It will be found, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>think, that the first crude drawings are valuable as throwing
light on the workings of children’s minds. Perhaps,
indeed, it may turn out that these spontaneous efforts of
the childish hand to figure objects are for the psychologist
a medium of expression of the whole of child-nature,
hardly less instructive than that of early speech.</p>

<p class='c001'>In carrying out our investigation of children’s drawings
we shall need to make a somewhat full reference to the
related phenomena, the drawings of modern savages and
those of early art. While important points of difference
will disclose themselves the resemblances are important
enough to make a comparison not only profitable but
almost indispensable.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have thought it best to narrow the range of the inquiry
by keeping to delineations of the human figure and of
animals, especially the horse. These are the favourite
topics of the child’s pencil, and examples of them are easily
obtainable.</p>

<p class='c001'>As far as possible I have sought spontaneous drawings
of quite young children, <i>viz.</i>, from between two and three
to about six.<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c011'><sup>[229]</sup></a> In a strict sense of course no child’s drawing
is absolutely spontaneous and independent of external
stimulus and guidance. The first attempts to manage the
pencil are commonly aided by the mother, who, moreover,
is wont to present a model drawing, and, what is even more
important at this early stage, to supply model-movements
of the arm and hand. In most cases, too, there is some
slight amount of critical inspection, as when she asks, ‘Where
is papa’s nose?’ ‘Where is doggie’s tail?’ Yet perfect
spontaneity, even if obtainable, is not necessary here. The
drawings of men and quadrupeds of a child of five and
later disclose plainly enough the childish fashion, even
though there has been some slight amount of elementary
instruction. Hence I have not hesitated to make use of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>drawings sent me by kindergarten teachers. I may add
that I have used by preference the drawings executed by
children in elementary schools, as these appear to illustrate
the childish manner with less of parental interference than
is wont to be present in a cultured home.</p>

<p class='c001'>A child’s drawing begins with a free aimless swinging
of the pencil to and fro, which movements produce a chaos
of slightly curved lines. These movements are purely
spontaneous, or, if imitative, are so only in the sense that
they follow at a considerable distance the movements of
the mother’s pencil.<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c011'><sup>[230]</sup></a> They may be made expressive or
significant in two ways. In the first place, a child may by
varying the swinging movements accidentally produce
an effect which suggests an idea through a remote resemblance.
A little boy when two years and two months,
was one day playing in this wise with the pencil, and
happening to make a sort of curling line, shouted with
excited glee, ‘Puff, puff!’ <i>i.e.</i>, smoke. He then drew
more curls with a rudimentary intention to show what he
meant. In like manner when a child happens to bend his
line into something like a closed circle or ellipse he will
catch the faint resemblance to the rounded human head
and exclaim, ‘Mama!’ or ‘Dada!’</p>

<p class='c001'>But intentional drawing or designing does not always
arise in this way. A child may set himself to draw, and
make believe that he is drawing something when he is
scribbling. This is largely an imitative play-action
following the direction of the movements of another’s hand.
Preyer speaks of a little boy who in his second year was
asked when scribbling with a pencil what he was doing
and answered ‘writing houses’. He was apparently
making believe that his jumble of lines represented houses.<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c011'><sup>[231]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>Almost any scribble may in this earliest stage take on a
meaning through the play of a vigorous childish imagination.</p>

<div id='fig1'  class='figleft id002'>
<img src='images/i_p334_1.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Fig. 1 (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The same play of imagination is noticeable in the child’s
first endeavours to draw an object
from memory when he is asked to
do so. Thus a little girl in her
fourth year referred to by Mr. E.
Cooke when asked to draw a cat
produced a longish irregularly
curved line crossed by a number
of shorter lines, which strange production
she proceeded quite complacently
to dignify by the name
‘cat,’ naming the whiskers, legs, and tail (Fig. 1 (<a href='#fig1'><i>a</i></a>); compare
the slightly fuller design in Fig. 1 (<a href='#fig1'><i>b</i></a>)).<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c011'><sup>[232]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Here it is evident we have a phase of childish drawing
which is closely analogous to the symbolism of language.
The representation is arbitrarily chosen as a symbol and not
as a likeness. This element of a non-imitative or symbolic
mode of representation will be found to run through the
whole of childish drawing.</p>

<p class='c001'>Even this chaotic scribble shows almost from the
beginning germs of formative elements, not merely in the
fundamental line-elements, but also in the loops, and in the
more abrupt changes of direction or angles. A tendency
to draw a loop-like rudimentary contour soon emerges, and
thus we get the transition to a possible outlining of objects.
Miss Shinn gives a good example of an ovoid loop drawn
by her niece in her hundred and ninth week.<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c011'><sup>[233]</sup></a> With
practice the child acquires by the second or third year the
usual stock in trade of the juvenile draughtsman, and can
draw a sort of straight line, curved lines, a roughish kind
of circle or oval, as well as dots, and even fit lines together
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>at angles.<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c011'><sup>[234]</sup></a> When this stage is reached we begin to see
attempts at real though rude likenesses of men, horses and
so forth. These early essays are among the most curious
products of the child-mind. They follow standards and
methods of their own; they are apt to get hardened into a
fixed conventional manner which may reappear even in
mature years. They exhibit with a certain range of
individual difference a curious uniformity, and they have
their parallels in what we know of the first crude designs
of the untutored savage.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><i>First Drawings of the Human Figure.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>It has been wittily observed by an Italian writer on
children’s art that they reverse the order of natural creation
in beginning instead of ending with man.<a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c011'><sup>[235]</sup></a> It may be
added that they start with the most dignified part of this
crown of creation, <i>viz.</i>, the human head. A child’s first
attempt to represent a man proceeds, so far as I have
observed, by drawing the front view of his head. This he
effects by means of a clumsy sort of circle with a dot or two
thrown in by way of indicating features in general. A couple
of lines may be inserted as a kind of support, which do duty
for both trunk and legs. The circular or ovoid form is, I
think, by far the most common. The square head in my
collection appears only very occasionally and in children
<em>at school</em>, who presumably have had some training in
drawing horizontal and vertical lines. The accompanying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>example (Fig. <a href='#fig2'>2</a>) is the work of a Jamaica girl of five,
kindly sent me by her teacher.</p>

<div id='fig2'  class='figleft id002'>
<img src='images/i_p336_2.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Fig. 2.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>This first attempt to outline the
human form is, no doubt, characterised
by a high degree of arbitrary
symbolism. The use of a rude form
of circle to set forth the human head
reminds one of the employment by
living savage tribes of the same form
as the symbol of a house (hut?), a
wreath, and so forth.<a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c011'><sup>[236]</sup></a> Yet there is
a measure of resemblance even in
this abstract symbolism: the circle
does roughly resemble the contour of the head: as, indeed,
the square or rectangle may be said less obviously to do
when hair and whiskers and the horizontal line of the hat
break the curved line.</p>

<div id='fig3'  class='figleft id002'>
<img src='images/i_p336_3.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Fig. 3.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But it is not the mere contour which represents the face:
it is a circle picked out with features. These,
however vaguely indicated, are an integral
part of the facial scheme. This is illustrated
in the fact that among the drawings by
savages and others collected by General Pitt-Rivers,
one, executed by an adult negro of
Uganda, actually omits the contour, the
human head being represented merely by an
arrangement of dark patches and circles for
eyes, ears, etc. (Fig. <a href='#fig3'>3</a>).<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c011'><sup>[237]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Coming now to the mode of representing
the features, we find at an early stage of
this schematic delineation an attempt to
differentiate and individualise features, not only by giving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>definite position but by a rough imitation of form. Thus
we get the vertical line as indicating the direction of the
nose, the horizontal line that of the mouth, and either
a rounded dot or a circular line as representative of the
curved outline of the eye—whether that of the iris, of the
visible part of the eyeball, or of the orbital cavity. A
precisely similar scheme appears in the drawings of
savages.<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c011'><sup>[238]</sup></a></p>

<div id='fig4ab'  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/i_p338_4ab.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Fig. 4 (<i>a</i>). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fig. 4 (<i>b</i>).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>At first the child is grandly indifferent to completeness
in the enumeration of features. Even ‘the two
eyes, a nose and a mouth’ are often imperfectly represented.
Thus when dots are used we may have one or more
specks ranging, according to M. Perez, up to five.<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c011'><sup>[239]</sup></a>
The use of a single dot for facial feature in general
has its parallel in the art of savage tribes.<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c011'><sup>[240]</sup></a> It is,
however, I think, most common to introduce three dots
in a triangular arrangement, presumably for eyes and
mouth,—a device again which reappears in the art of
uncivilised races.<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c011'><sup>[241]</sup></a>  Even when the young draughtsman
has reached the stage of distinguishing the features he
may be quite careless about number and completeness.
Thus a feature may be omitted altogether. This funnily
enough happens most frequently in the case of that one
which seems to us ‘grown-ups’ most self-assertive and
most resentful of indignity, <i>viz.</i>, the nose. These moon-faces
with two eyes and a mouth are very common
among the first drawings of children. The mouth, on
the other hand, is much less frequently omitted. The
same thing seems to hold good of the drawings of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>savages.<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c011'><sup>[242]</sup></a> The eyes are rarely omitted. The single dot
may perhaps be said to stand for ‘eye’. Some drawings
of savages have
the two eyes and no
other feature, as in
the accompanying example
from Andree,
plate 3 (Fig. 4 <a href='#fig4ab'>(<i>a</i>)</a>).
On the other hand, a
child will, as we have
seen, sometimes content
himself with one
eye. This holds good
not only where the
dot is used but after
something like an eye-circle is introduced, as in the
accompanying drawing by a Jamaica girl of seven (Fig.
4 <a href='#fig4ab'>(<i>b</i>)</a>).</p>

<div id='fig4c'  class='figright id002'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Fig. 4 (<i>c</i>).—Moustache = horizontal line above curve of cap.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>In these first attempts to sketch out a face we miss a
sense of relative position and of proportion. It is astonishing
what a child on first attempting to draw a human or
animal form can do in the way of dislocation or putting things
into the wrong place. The little girl mentioned by E.
Cooke on trying, about the same age, to draw a cat from
a model actually put the circle representing the eye
outside that of the head. With this may be compared
the drawings of Von den Steinen and other Europeans
made by his Brazil Indian companions, in which what
was distinctly said by the draughtsman to be the moustache
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>was in more than one instance set above the eyes
(Fig. 4 <a href='#fig4c'>(<i>c</i>)</a>). When dots are inserted
in the linear scheme they
are apt at first to be thrown in
anyhow. The two eyes, I find,
when these only are given, may be
put one above the other as well as
one by the side of the other, and
both arrangements occur in the
drawings of the same child. And
much later when greater attention
to position is observable there is a
general tendency to put the group
of features too high up, <i>i.e.</i>, to make the forehead or brain
region too small in proportion to the chin region (<i>cf.</i> above,
Fig. <a href='#fig2'>2</a>, p. 336).<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c011'><sup>[243]</sup></a></p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Fig. 5 (<i>a</i>).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The want of proportion is still more plainly seen in
the treatment of the several features.
The eye, as already remarked, is apt
to be absurdly large. In the drawing
of Mr. Cooke’s little girl mentioned
above it is actually larger than the
head outside which it lies. This
enlargement continues to appear
frequently in later drawings, more
particularly when one eye only is
introduced, as in the accompanying
drawing by a boy in his seventh year (Fig. 5 <a href='#fig5a'>(<i>a</i>)</a>;
<i>cf.</i> above, Fig. 4 <a href='#fig4ab'>(<i>b</i>)</a>). The mouth is apt to be
even more disproportionate, the child appearing to
delight in making this appalling feature supreme,
as in the following examples, both by boys of five
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>(Fig. 5 <a href='#fig5b'>(<i>b</i>)</a> and <a href='#fig5c'>(<i>c</i>)</a>). The ear, when it is added, is apt
to be enormous, and generally
the introduction of new
details as ears, hair, hands, is
wont to be emphasised by
an exaggeration of their
magnitude.</p>

<p class='c001'>Very interesting is the
gradual artistic evolution of
the features. Here, as in
organic evolution, there is a
process of specialisation, the
primordial indefinite form taking on more of characteristic
complexity. In the case of the eye, for example, we
may often trace a gradual development, the dot being
displaced by a small circle or ovoid, this last supplemented
by a second circle outside the first,<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c011'><sup>[244]</sup></a> or by one or by
two arches, the former placed above, the latter above
and below the circle. The form remains throughout
an abstract outline or scheme, there being no attempt to
draw even the lines—<i>e.g.</i>, those of the lid-margins—correctly,
or to indicate differences of light and dark, save
in the case where a central black dot is used. In this
schematic treatment so striking and interesting a feature as
the eye-lash only very rarely finds a place. A similar
schematic treatment of the eye in the use of a dot, a dot
in a circle, and two circles, is observable in the drawings of
savages and of Egyptian and other archaic art.<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c011'><sup>[245]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The evolution of the mouth is particularly interesting.
It is wont to begin with a horizontal line (or what seems
intended for such) which is frequently drawn right across
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>the facial circle. But a transition soon takes place to a
more distinctive representation. This is naturally enough
carried out by the introduction of the characteristic and
interesting detail, the teeth. This may be done, according
to M. Perez, by keeping to the linear representation, the
teeth being indicated by dots placed upon the horizontal
line. In all the cases observed by me the teeth are introduced
in a more realistic fashion in connexion with a contour
to suggest the parted lips. The contour—especially
the circular or ovoid—occasionally appears by itself without
teeth, but the teeth seem to be soon added. The
commonest forms of tooth-cavity I have met with are a
narrow rectangular and a curved spindle-shaped slit with
teeth appearing as vertical lines (see the two drawings by
boys of six and five, Fig. 6 <a href='#fig6a'>(<i>a</i>)</a> and <a href='#fig6b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>). These two forms
are improved upon and more likeness is introduced by
making the dental lines shorter, as in Fig. 5 <a href='#fig5c'>(<i>c</i>)</a> (p. 340).
With this may be compared a drawing by a boy of five
(Fig. 6 <a href='#fig6c'>(<i>c</i>)</a>), where however we see a movement from
realism in the direction of a freer decorative treatment.</p>

<p class='c001'>A somewhat similar process of evolution is noticeable in
the case of the nose, though here the movement is soon
brought to a standstill. Thus the vertical line gives place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>to an angle, which may point to the side, as in the drawing
of a country-boy between three and four (Fig. 7 <a href='#fig7a'>(<i>a</i>)</a>), but
more frequently, I think, points upwards, as in the drawing
of a boy of six (Fig. 7 <a href='#fig7b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>). This in its turn leads to an
isosceles triangle with an acute angle at the apex, as in the
drawing of a boy of six (Fig. 7 (<i>c</i>)). In a few cases a long
spindle-shaped or rectangular form similar to that of the
mouth is employed, as in a drawing of a nervous child of six
(Fig. 7 (<i>d</i>)). Refinements are introduced now and again by
an attempt at the nostrils, as in the accompanying curious
drawing by a seven-years-old Jamaica girl (Fig. 7 <a href='#fig7e'>(<i>e</i>)</a>).<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c011'><sup>[246]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The introduction of other features, more especially
ears and hair, must, according to my observations, be
looked on as occasional only, and as a mark of an
advance to a more naturalistic treatment. Differences
of treatment occur here too. Thus the ears, which
are apt to be absurdly large, are now inserted inside
the head circle, now outside it. The hair appears
now as a dark cap of horizontal strokes, now as a
kind of stunted fringe, now as a bundle or wisp
on one side, which may
either fall or stand on
end (see above, Fig. 7 <a href='#fig7d'>(<i>d</i>)</a>,
and the accompanying
drawing by a girl of
nearly four, Fig. 8 <a href='#fig8a'>(<i>a</i>)</a>).
These methods of representation
are occasionally
varied by a more
elaborate line-device, as
a curly looped line similar
to that employed for
smoke, as in the annexed
drawing by a girl of seven (Fig. 8 <a href='#fig8b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>).</p>

<p>Fig. 9.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>As implied in this account of the facial features, a good
deal of convention-like agreement of method is enlivened
by a measure of diversity of treatment. Perhaps one of
the most striking instances of daring originality
is seen in the attempt by a girl of four—who
was subjected to a great deal of instruction—to
give separate form to the chin (Fig. <a href='#fig9'>9</a>). This
may be compared with the attempt of the
Uganda negro to indicate symbolically the
cheeks (see above, p. 336, Fig. <a href='#fig3'>3</a>).</p>

<p class='c001'>As I have remarked, to the child bent on representing
‘man’ the head or face is at first the principal thing, some
early drawings contenting themselves with this. But in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>general the head receives some support. The simplest
device here is the abstract mode of representation by two
supporting lines, which do duty for legs and body. These
are for the most part parallel (see above, p. 336, Fig. <a href='#fig2'>2</a>),
though occasionally they are united at the top, making a
kind of target figure. This same arrangement,
fixing the head on two upright lines,
meets us also in the rude designs of savages,
as may be seen in the accompanying rock
inscription from Schoolcraft (Fig. <a href='#fig10'>10</a>).<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c011'><sup>[247]</sup></a></p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The comparative indifference of the child to the body
or trunk is seen in the obstinate persistence of this simple
scheme of head and legs, to which two arms attached to
the sides of the head are often added. A child will
complete the drawing of the head by inserting hair or a
cap, and will even add feet
and hands, before he
troubles to bring in the
trunk (see above, p. 336,
Fig. <a href='#fig2'>2</a>, and p. 342, Fig. 7 <a href='#fig7d'>(<i>d</i>)</a>, also the accompanying
drawing by a boy of six,
Fig. 11 <a href='#fig11a'>(<i>a</i>)</a>). With this
neglect of the trunk by
children may be compared
the omission of it—as if it
were a forbidden thing—in
one of General Pitt-Rivers’
drawings, executed by a Zulu woman (Fig.
<a href='#fig11b'>11(<i>b</i>)</a>).</p>

<p class='c001'>From this common way of spiking the head on two
forked or upright legs there is one important deviation.
The contour of the head may be left incomplete, and the
upper occipital part of the curve be run on into the leg-lines,
as in the accompanying example by a Jamaica girl
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>of seven (Fig. <a href='#fig12'>12</a>). I have met with no example of this
among English children.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Fig. 12.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The drawing of the trunk may
commence in one of two ways.
With English children it appears
often to emerge as an expansion
or prolongation of the head-contour,
as in the accompanying drawings
of the front and side view (Fig.
13 <a href='#fig13a'>(<i>a</i>)</a> and <a href='#fig13b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>).<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c011'><sup>[248]</sup></a> Or, in the second
place, the leg-scheme may be modified,
either by drawing a horizontal
line across them and so making a
rectangle, as in the accompanying
drawing by a boy of six, or by shading in the
upper part of the space, as in the other figure by a girl
of five (Fig. 13 <a href='#fig13c'>(<i>c</i>)</a> and <a href='#fig13d'>(<i>d</i>)</a>). A curious and interesting
variant of this second mode of introducing the trunk is to be
found in the drawings of Von den Steinen’s Brazilians, where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>the leg-lines are either kept parallel for a while and then
made to diverge, or are pinched
in below what may be called
the pelvis, though not completely
joined (Fig. 13 <a href='#fig13ef'>(<i>e</i>)</a> and
<a href='#fig13ef'>(<i>f</i>)</a>).</p>

<p class='c001'>When the trunk is distinctly
marked off, it is apt to remain
small in proportion to the
head, as in the following two
drawings by boys of about five (Fig. 14 <a href='#fig14a'>(<i>a</i>)</a> and <a href='#fig14b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>).
As to its shape, it is most commonly circular or ovoid
like the head. But the square or rectangular form is also
found, and in the case of certain children it is expressly
stated that this came later. A triangular cape-like form
also appears now and again, as in the accompanying drawing
by a boy of six (Fig. 14 <a href='#fig14c'>(<i>c</i>)</a>).<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c011'><sup>[249]</sup></a> The treatment of the
form of trunk often varies in the drawings of the same child.</p>

<p class='c001'>At this stage there is no attempt to show the joining on
of the head to the trunk by means of the neck. The oval
of the head is either laid on the top of that of the trunk, or
more commonly cuts off the upper end of the latter. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>neck, when first added, is apt to take the exaggerated look
of caricature. It may be
represented by a single
line, by a couple of parallel
lines, or by a small
oval or circle, as in the
accompanying drawings
by a girl of six and a
boy of five respectively
(Fig. 15 <a href='#fig15a'>(<i>a</i>)</a> and <a href='#fig15b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>;

</div>

<p class='c001'>It is noticeable that there is sometimes a double body,
two oval contours being laid one upon the other. In certain
cases this looks
very like an expansion
of the
neck, as in the
accompanying
drawing by the
same boy that drew
the round neck
above (Fig. 16 <a href='#fig16a'>(<i>a</i>)</a>).
In other cases the
arrangement
plainly does not
aim at differentiating
the neck, since this part is separately dealt with (Fig.
16 <a href='#fig16b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>). Here it may possibly mean a crude attempt to
indicate the division of the trunk at the waist, as brought
out especially by female attire, as may be seen in the
accompanying drawing where the dots for buttons on each
oval seem to show that the body is signified (Fig. 16 <a href='#fig16c'>(<i>c</i>)</a>; <i>cf.</i>
above, p. 342, Fig. 7 <a href='#fig7c'>(<i>c</i>)</a>).<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c011'><sup>[250]</sup></a> This, along with the triangular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>cape-shape of the trunk, is one of the few illustrations of
the effect of dress on the first childish treatment of the
figure. As a rule, this primitive art is a study of nature
in so far as the artificial adjuncts of dress are ignored,
and the rounded forms of the body are, though crudely
enough no doubt, hinted at.</p>

<p class='c001'>Coming now to the arms we find that their introduction
is very uncertain. To the child, as also to the savage,
the arms are what the Germans call a Nebensache—side-matter
(<i>i.e.</i>, figuratively as well as literally), and are omitted
in rather more than one case out of two. After all, the
divine portion, the head, can be supported very well
without their help.</p>

<div id='fig17'  class='figleft id008'>
<img src='images/i_p348_17.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Fig. 17.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The arms, as well as the legs, being the thin lanky members,
are commonly represented by lines.
The same thing is noticeable in the drawings
of savages.<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c011'><sup>[251]</sup></a> The arms appear in the
front view of the figure as stretched out
horizontally, or, at least, reaching out
from the sides; and their appearance
always gives a certain liveliness to the
figure, an air of joyous self-proclamation,
as if they said in their gesture-language,
‘Here I am’ (see above, p. 339, Fig. 5 <a href='#fig5a'>(<i>a</i>)</a>,
and the accompanying drawing of a
boy of six, Fig. <a href='#fig17'>17</a>).</p>

<p class='c001'>In respect of shape and structure a process of evolution
may be observed. In certain cases the abstract linear
representation gives place to contour, the arm being drawn
of a certain thickness. But I find that the linear representation
of the arm often persists after the legs have
received contour, this being probably another illustration of
the comparative neglect of the arm; as in the accompanying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>drawing by a boy of five (Fig. 18 (<a href='#fig18a'><i>a</i></a>)). The primal rigid
straightness yields later on to the freedom of an organ. Thus
an attempt is made to represent by means of a curve the look
of the bent arm, as in the accompanying drawings by boys
of five (Fig. 18 <a href='#fig18b'>(<i>b</i>)</a> and <a href='#fig18c'>(<i>c</i>)</a>). In other cases the angle of the
elbow is indicated. This last comes comparatively late in
children’s drawings, which here, too, lag behind the crudest
outline sketches of savages.</p>

<p class='c001'>The mode of insertion or attachment of the arms is
noteworthy. Where they are added to the trunkless figure
they appear as emerging either from the sides of the head,
as in the accompanying drawing
by a boy of two and a half years,
or from the point of junction of
the head and legs (Fig. <a href='#fig19'>19</a>; <i>cf.</i>
above, p. 342, Fig.7  <a href='#fig7d'>(<i>d</i>)</a> and
<a href='#fig7e'>(<i>e</i>)</a>). In the case of savage
drawings wanting the trunk
the arm is also inserted at this
point of junction (see above, pp. 344, 346, Figs. <a href='#fig10'>10</a> and
13 <a href='#fig13a'>(<i>f</i>)</a>).<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c011'><sup>[252]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>After the trunk has been added, the mode of insertion
varies still more. In a not inconsiderable number of cases
the arms spring from the bottom of the head-circle, and
sometimes even from the median region, as before the
trunk appeared (<i>cf.</i> above, p. 346, Fig. 14 <a href='#fig14b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>). In the last
case the most grotesque arrangements occur, as if the arms
might sprout at any point of the surface.<a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c011'><sup>[253]</sup></a> In the majority
of cases, however, and certainly among the better drawings,
the arms spring from the side of the trunk towards the
median level (<i>cf.</i> above, p. 341, Fig. 6 <a href='#fig6a'>(<i>a</i>)</a>).</p>

<p class='c001'>The length of the arm is frequently exaggerated. This
adds to the self-expansive and self-proclamatory look of
the mannikin, as may be seen in the accompanying
drawings by boys of five and of six respectively (Fig.
20 <a href='#fig20a'>(<i>a</i>)</a> and <a href='#fig20b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>).</p>

<p class='c001'>This arrangement of the arms stretched straight out, or
less commonly pointing obliquely upwards or downwards,
continues until the child grows bold enough to represent
actions. When this stage is reached their form and length
may be materially modified, as also their position.<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c011'><sup>[254]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>The arm in these childish drawings early develops the

<p class='c001'>The treatment of the hand illustrates the process of
artistic evolution, the movement from a bold symbolism in
the direction of a more life-like mode of representation.
Thus one of the earliest and rudest devices I have met with,
though in a few cases only, is that of drawing strokes
across the line of the arm by way of digital symbols. Here
we have merely a
clumsy attempt to
convey the abstract
idea of branching or
bifurcation. These
cross-strokes are
commonly continued
upwards so that the
whole visible part of
the arm becomes
tree-like. It is an
important step from this to the drawing of twig-like lines
which bifurcate with the line of the arm (Fig. 21 <a href='#fig21a'>(<i>a</i>)</a> and <a href='#fig21b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>).</p>

<p class='c001'>It is a still more significant advance in the process of
evolution when the digital bifurcations are placed rightly,
being concentrated in a bunch-like arrangement at the
extremity of the arm-line. Here, again, various modes of
treatment disclose themselves, marking stages in the
development of the artist.</p>

<p class='c001'>The simplest device would seem to be to draw one
short line on either side of the termination of the arm-line
so as to produce a rude kind of bird’s foot form. This may
be done clumsily by drawing a stroke across at right angles
to the line of the arm, or better by two independent strokes
making acute angles with this line. These two modes of
delineation manifestly represent a restriction of the two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>varieties of diffuse or dispersed treatment of the fingers
already illustrated. Both forms occur among children’s
drawings. They may be found among the drawings of
savages as well.<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c011'><sup>[255]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In this terminal finger-arrangement the number of
finger-lines varies greatly, being, in the cases observed by
me, frequently four and five, and sometimes even as great as
ten. It varies, too, greatly in the drawings of the same
child, and in some cases even in the two hands of the same
figure, showing that number is not attended to, as may be
seen in the two annexed drawings, both by boys of five
(Fig. 22 <a href='#fig22a'>(<i>a</i>)</a> and <a href='#fig22b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>). The idea seems to be to set forth a
multiplicity of branching
fingers, and multiplicity
here seems to
mean three or more.
The same way of
representing the hand
by a claw-form, in
which the number of
fingers is three or more, reappears in the drawings of
savages (<i>cf.</i> above, p. 339, Fig. 4 <a href='#fig4c'>(<i>c</i>)</a>).<a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c011'><sup>[256]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>An important advance on these crude devices is seen
where an attempt is made to indicate the hand and the
relation of the fingers to this. One of the earliest of these
attempts takes the form of the well-known toasting-fork or
rake hand. Here a line at right angles to that of the
arm symbolically represents the hand, and the fingers
are set forth by the prongs or teeth (see above, p. 341,
Fig. 6 <a href='#fig6a'>(<i>a</i>)</a>, and p. 349, Fig. 18 <a href='#fig18a'>(<i>a</i>)</a>). Number is here
as little attended to as in the radial arrangements. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>is worth noting that this <em>schema</em> seems to be widely
diffused among children of different nationalities, and
occurs in the drawings of untaught adults. I have
not, however, noticed any example of it among savage
drawings.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another way of bringing in the hand along with the
fingers is by drawing a dark central patch or knob. This
not infrequently occurs without the fingers as the symbol
for hand. It becomes a complete symbol by arranging
finger-lines after the pattern of a burr about this (see above,
p. 347, Fig. 15 <a href='#fig15a'>(<i>a</i>)</a>).</p>

<p class='c001'>A further process of artistic evolution occurs when the
fingers take on
contour. This
gives a look of
branching leaves
to the hand. The
leaf-like pattern
may be varied in
different ways,
among others by
taking on a floral
aspect of petal-like
fingers about
a centre, as in the
two annexed drawings by boys of six (Fig. 23 <a href='#fig23a'>(<i>a</i>)</a> and
<a href='#fig23b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>; <i>cf.</i> above, p. 350, Fig. 20 <a href='#fig20a'>(<i>a</i>)</a>).</p>

<p class='c001'>One curious arrangement by which a thickened arm
is made to expand into something like a fan-shaped
hand appears with considerable frequency. It is
zoologically interesting as being a kind of rough representation
of the fundamental typical form from which
hand, fin, and wing may be supposed to have been
evolved. Here the arm sinks into insignificance,
the whole limb taking on the aspect of a prolonged
hand, save where the artist resorts to the device of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>making the double organ go across the body (Fig. 24 (<i>a</i>)
and (<i>b</i>)).</p>

<p class='c001'>The legs come
in for very much
the same variety
of treatment as
the arms. The
abstract straight
line here, as already
pointed
out, soon gives
place to the pair of lines representing thickness. They are
for the most part parallel and drawn at some distance one
from the other, though in certain cases there is a slight
tendency to give to the figure the look of the ‘forked biped’
(<i>cf.</i> above, p. 342, Fig. 7 <a href='#fig7c'>(<i>c</i>)</a>). In a large proportion of cases
there is a marked inclination of the legs, as indeed of the
whole figure, which seems to be falling backwards (see
above, pp. 340, 352, Figs. 5 <a href='#fig5c'>(<i>c</i>)</a> and 22 <a href='#fig22b'><i>(b</i>)</a>). In many
instances, in front and profile view alike, one of the legs
is drawn under the body, leaving no room for the second,
which is consequently pushed behind, and takes on the
look of a tail (see above, p. 352, Fig. 22 <a href='#fig22b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>s).</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Both legs are regularly shown alike in front and in
profile view. Yet even in this simple case
attention to number may sometimes lapse.
Among the drawings collected by me is
one by a boy of five representing the
monster, a three-legged ‘biped’ (Fig. <a href='#fig25'>25</a>).<a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c011'><sup>[257]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The shape of the leg varies greatly.
With some children it is made short and
fat. It develops a certain amount of
curvature long before it develops a knee-bend.
This is just what we should expect.
The standing figure needs straight or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>approximately straight legs as its support. When the
knee-bend is introduced it is very apt to be exaggerated
(<i>cf.</i> above, Fig. 24 (<i>b</i>)). This becomes still more noticeable
at a later stage, where actions, as running, are attempted.</p>

<p>Fig. 26 (a).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The treatment of the foot shows a process of evolution
similar to that seen in the treatment of the hand. At first
a bald abstract indication or suggestion is noticeable, as
where a short line is drawn across the extremity of the leg.
In place of this a contour-form, more especially a circle
or knob, may be used as a designation. Very interesting
here is the differentiation of treatment according as the
booted or naked foot is represented. Children brought up
in a civilised community like England, though they sometimes
give the naked foot (see p. 342, Fig. 7 <a href='#fig7d'>(<i>d</i>)</a>, where the
claw pattern is adopted), are naturally more disposed to
envisage the foot under its boot-form. Among the drawings
of the Jamaica children, presumably more familiar with the
form of the naked foot, I find both the toasting-fork and
the burr arrangement, as also a rude claw, or birch-like device
used for the foot (see above, pp. 336, 338, 345, Figs.
<a href='#fig2'>2</a>, 4 <a href='#fig4ab'>(<i>b</i>)</a>, and <a href='#fig12'>12</a>). The toasting-fork arrangement appears
in General Pitt-Rivers’ collection of savage drawings. Also
a bird’s foot treatment often accompanies
a similar treatment of the hand
in the pictographs of savage tribes, and
in the drawings of Von den Steinen’s
Brazilians (see above, pp. 338, 339, Fig.
4 <a href='#fig4ab'>(<i>a</i>)</a> and <a href='#fig4c'>(<i>c</i>)</a>).</p>

<p class='c001'>An attempt to represent the booted
foot seems to be recognisable in the
early use of a triangular form, as in the
accompanying drawing by a small
artist of five (Fig. 26 (<i>a</i>)).<a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c011'><sup>[258]</sup></a> Very curious
is the way in which the child seeks to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>indicate the capital feature of the boot, the division of
toe and heel. This is very
frequently done by continuing
the line of the leg so as to
make a single or a double loop-pattern,
as in the following
(Fig. 26 <a href='#fig26b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>, <a href='#fig26c'>(<i>c</i>)</a>; <i>cf.</i> above, p. 342,
Fig. 7 <a href='#fig7b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>). A tendency to a
more restrained and naturalistic
treatment is sometimes seen
(see above, p. 354, Fig. 24 <a href='#fig24a'>(<i>a</i>)</a>
and <a href='#fig24b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>). It may be added that
the notch between toe and heel
is almost always exaggerated.
This may be seen by a glance at Figs. <a href='#fig17'>17</a> and 22 <a href='#fig22a'>(<i>a</i>)</a>, pp.
348, 352. The same thing is noticeable in a drawing by
a young Zulu in General Pitt-Rivers’ collection.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><i>Front and Side View of Human Figure.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>So far, I have dealt only with the treatment of the front
view of the human face and figure. New and highly curious
characteristics come into view when the child attempts
to give the profile aspect. This comes considerably later
than the early lunar representation of the full face.</p>

<p class='c001'>Children still more than adults are interested in the full
face with its two flashing and fascinating eyes. ‘If,’ writes
a lady teacher of considerable experience in the Kindergarten,
‘one makes drawings in profile for quite little children,
they will not be satisfied unless they see two eyes; and
sometimes they turn a picture round to see the other side.’
This reminds one of a story told by Catlin of the Indian
chief, who was so angry at a representation of himself in
profile that the unfortunate artist was in fear of his life.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the same time children do not rest content with this
front view. There is, I believe, ample reason to say that,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>quite apart from teaching, they find their own way to a new
mode of representing the face and figure which, though it
would be an error to call it a profile drawing, has some of
the characteristics of what we understand by this expression.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first clear indication of an attempt to give the
profile aspect of the face is the introduction of the angular
line of the side view of the nose into the contour. The
little observer is soon impressed by the characteristic,
well-marked outline of the nose in profile; and as he
cannot make much of the front view of the organ,
he naturally begins at an early stage, certainly by the
fifth year, to vary the scheme of the lunar circle, broken
at most by the ears, by a projection answering to a profile
nose.</p>

<div id='fig27'  class='figright id008'>
<img src='images/i_p357_27.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Fig. 27.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>This change is sometimes made without any other, so
that we get what has been called the mixed
scheme, in which the eyes and mouth retain
their front-view aspect. This I find very
common among children of five. It may be
found—even in the trunkless figure—along
with a linear mouth (see above, pp. 340-344,
Figs. 5 <a href='#fig5c'>(<i>c</i>)</a> and following, also 11 <a href='#fig11a'>(<i>a</i>)</a>). The
nasal line is, needless to say, treated with
great freedom. There is commonly a good
deal of exaggeration of size. In certain
cases the nose is added in the form of a spindle to the
completed circle (Fig. <a href='#fig27'>27</a>; <i>cf.</i> above, p. 340, Fig. 5 <a href='#fig5c'>(<i>c</i>)</a>).</p>

<p class='c001'>It may well seem a puzzle to us how a normal child of
five or six can complacently set down this irrational and
inconsistent scheme of a human head. We must see what
can be said by way of explanation later on. It is to be
noticed, further, that in certain cases the self-contradiction
goes to the point of doubling the nose. That is to say,
although the interesting new feature, the profile nose, is
introduced, earlier habit asserts itself so that the vertical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>nasal line appears between the two eyes (see above, p. 349,
Fig. 18 <a href='#fig18c'>(<i>c</i>)</a>).</p>

<p class='c001'>The further process of differentiation of the profile from
the primitive full-face scheme is effected in part by adding
other features than the nose to the contour. Thus a notch
for the mouth appears in some cases below the nasal projection
(Fig. 28 <a href='#fig28a'>(<i>a</i>)</a>), though the grinning front view is apt
to hold its own pertinaciously.
A beard,
especially the short
‘imperial,’ as it used
to be called, shooting
out like the nose
from the side, also
helps to mark profile.<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c011'><sup>[259]</sup></a>
Less frequently an
ear, and in a very
few cases, hair, are
added on the hinder
side of the head, and
assist the impression
of profile. Adjuncts, especially the pipe, and sometimes
the peak of the cap, contribute to the effect, as in the
accompanying drawing by a boy of six (Fig. 28 <a href='#fig28b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>; <i>cf.</i>
above, Figs. 6 <a href='#fig6a'>(<i>a</i>)</a>, 18 (<a href='#fig18c'><i>c</i>)</a>, and 24 <a href='#fig24b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>, pp. 341, 349, 354).<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c011'><sup>[260]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>At the same time the front features themselves undergo
modification. The big grinning mouth is dropped and one
of the eyes omitted. The exact way in which this occurs
appears to vary with different children. In certain cases
it is clear that the front view of the mouth cavity disappears,
giving place to a rough attempt to render a side view,
before the second eye is expunged; and in one case I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>detected a survival of the two eyes in what otherwise would be
a consistent profile drawing of head and figure (Fig. 29 <a href='#fig29a'>(<i>a</i>)</a>;
<i>cf.</i> above, p. 349, Fig. 18 <a href='#fig18b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>). This late survival of the two
eyes agrees with the results of observation on the drawings of
the uncultured adult. One of General Pitt-Rivers’ African
boys inserted the two eyes in a profile drawing. Von den
Steinen’s Brazilians drew by preference the full face, so
that we cannot well judge as to how they would have
treated the profile. Yet it is curious to note that in
what is clearly a drawing of a side view of a fish one of
these Brazilians introduces both eyes (Fig. 29 <a href='#fig29b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>). The
insertion of two eyes is said by some never to occur in the
drawings of savages on stone, hide, etc.<a id='r261' /><a href='#f261' class='c011'><sup>[261]</sup></a> But I have come
across what seems to me a clear example of it, and this in
a fairly good sketch of a profile view of the human figure
on an Indian vase (Fig. 29 <a href='#fig29c'>(<i>c</i>)</a>).<a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c011'><sup>[262]</sup></a> Yet this late retention of
the two eyes in profile, though the general rule in children’s
drawings, is liable to exceptions. Thus I have found a
child retaining the big front view of the mouth along with
a single eye.</p>

<p class='c001'>It may be added that children at a particular stage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>show a preference for some one arrangement; for example,
the profile nose and mouth, and the two front-view eyes,
which tends to become the habitual form used, though a
certain amount of variation is observable. The differences
noticeable among different children’s drawings suggest
that all of them do not go through the same stages. Thus
some may pass by the two-eyed profile stage altogether, or
very soon rise above it, whereas others may linger in it.<a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c011'><sup>[263]</sup></a></p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>One notices, too, curious divergences with respect to
the mixture of incompatible features.
Differences in the degree of intelligence
show themselves here also. Thus in one
case a child, throughout whose drawings
a certain feeble-mindedness seems to betray
itself, actually went so far as to introduce
the double nose without having the excuse
of the two eyes (Fig. <a href='#fig30'>30</a>). In such odd
ways do the tricks of habit assert themselves.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Fig. 31 (a).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The difficulty which the child feels in
these profile representations is seen in the odd positions
given to the eyes. These are apt to be
pushed very high up, to be placed one
above the other, and, what is more significant,
to be put far apart and close to the
line of contour (see above, Fig. 29 <a href='#fig29a'>(<i>a</i>)</a>). In
the following drawing by a boy of five one
of the eyes may be said to be on this line
(Fig 31 <a href='#fig31a'>(<i>a</i>)</a>). In General Pitt-Rivers’ collection
we find a still more striking instance
of this in a drawing by a boy of eleven,
the second eye appearing to be intentionally
put outside the contour, as if to suggest that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>we must look round to the other side of the facial disc in
order to see it (Fig. 31 <a href='#fig31b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>). Curious variations
of treatment appear, as in inserting two eyes
between the same pair of curves as in Fig.
20 <a href='#fig20b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>, p. 350, and in enclosing two pairs of
dots or small circles in two larger circles
as in Figs. 14 <a href='#fig14b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>, and 22 <a href='#fig22a'>(<i>a</i>)</a>, pp. 346, 352
(both by the same boy).<a id='r264' /><a href='#f264' class='c011'><sup>[264]</sup></a></p>

<div id='fig31b'  class='figright id012'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Fig. 31 (<i>b</i>).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It may be added that even when only one
eye is drawn, a reminiscence of the anterior
view is seen in its form. It is the round or
spindle-shaped contour of the eye as seen in
front. That is to say the eye of the profile like that of the full
face looks directly at the spectator, so that in a manner the one-eyed
profile is a front view (see for an example, Fig. 5 <a href='#fig5a'>(<i>a</i>)</a>, p.
339). The designs of savages, and the archaic art of civilised
races, including a people so high up as the Egyptians, share
this tendency of children’s drawings of the profile, though we
find scarcely a trace of the tendency to insert both eyes.</p>

<p class='c001'>A like confusion or want of differentiation shows itself
in the management of other features in the profile view.
As observed, a good large ear at the back sometimes helps
to indicate the side view (see above, p. 341, Fig. 6 <a href='#fig6a'>(<i>a</i>)</a>).
But the wish to bring in all the features, seen in the obstinate
retention of the two eyes, shows itself also in respect of the
ears. Thus one occasionally finds the two ears as in the front
view (see above, p. 346, Fig. 14 <a href='#fig14a'>(<i>a</i>)</a>, where the aspect is clearly
more front view than profile), and sometimes, according to
M. Passy—as if the profile nose interfered with this arrangement—both
placed together on one side. The treatment of
the moustache when this is introduced follows that of the
mouth. So imposing a feature must be given in all the
glory of the front view (see above, p. 350, Fig. 20 <a href='#fig20a'>(<i>b</i>)</a>).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Other curious features of this early crude attempt to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>deal with the profile show themselves in the handling of
the trunk and the limbs. I have met with
only one or two instances of a profile head
appearing before the addition of the trunk
as in Fig. 28 <a href='#fig28a'>(<i>a</i>)</a> (p. 358). In the large
majority of cases the trunk appears and
retains the circular or oval form of the
primitive front view. When, as very frequently
happens, the interesting vertical row
of buttons is added it is apt to be inserted
in the middle, giving a still more definitely
frontal aspect. The juxtaposition of this
with the head turned to the left need cause
no difficulty to the little draughtsman, after
what he has comfortably swallowed in the
shape of incompatibilities in the face itself
(see above, p. 347, Fig. 15 <a href='#fig15b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>). In rare cases, however, one
may light on a distinctly lateral treatment of the buttons.
In one instance I have found it in a drawing which would be
a consistent profile but for the insertion of the second eye,
and the frontal treatment of the legs and feet (Fig. <a href='#fig32'>32</a>).</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Fig. 33.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>In the arrangement of the arms there is more room
for confusion. The management of these in the profile
view naturally gives difficulty to the little artist, and in
some cases we find him shirking the point by retaining the
front view or spread-eagle
arrangement. This occurs
as a rule where the profile
modification is limited to the
introduction of a lateral nose
or nose and pipe (see, <i>e.g.</i>,
Figs. 24 (<i>a</i>) and 28 (<i>b</i>), pp.
354, 358). What is more
surprising is that it appears in
rare cases in drawings which
otherwise would be fairly consistent profile sketches. [Fig. <a href='#fig33'>33</a>;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>all this child’s completed drawings, four in number, adopt
the same front-view scheme of arms.]</p>

<p class='c001'>The view of the profile with both arms stretched out in
front seems, however, early to impress itself on the child’s
imagination, and an attempt is made to introduce this
striking arrangement. The addition of the forward-reaching
arms helps greatly to give a profile aspect to the figure
(see above, p. 349, Fig. 18 <a href='#fig18b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>).</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Fig. 34.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The addition of the forward-reaching arms is carried
out more especially when it is
desired to represent an action,
as in the drawing given above,
p. 342, Fig. 7 <a href='#fig7c'>(<i>c</i>)</a>, by a boy of
six, which represents a nurse
apparently walking behind a
child, and in the accompanying
figure, by a boy of eight and
a half, of an Irishman knocking a man’s head inside a
tent (Fig. <a href='#fig34'>34</a>).</p>

<p>Fig. 35b.</p>
</div>
</div>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The crudest mode of representing the side view of the
forward-reaching
arms is by drawing
the lines from the
contour, as in Fig.
35 <a href='#fig35a'>(<i>a</i>)</a>. Difficulties
arise when the lines
are carried across
the trunk. Very
often both arms are
drawn in this way,
as in Fig. 35 <a href='#fig35b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>.
There is a certain
analogy here to the insertion of the two eyes in the profile
representation, a second feature being in each case added
which in the original object is hidden.<a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c011'><sup>[265]</sup></a></p>

<div id='fig36'  class='figleft id009'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>
<img src='images/i_p364_36.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Fig. 36.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>When the two arms are thus introduced their position
varies greatly, whether they start from the contour or are
drawn across the body. That is to say, they may be far
one from the other (as in Fig. 35 <a href='#fig35b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>),
or may be drawn close together. And
again the point of common origin may be
high up at the meeting point of trunk and
chin, as in a drawing by a boy of five (Fig.
<a href='#fig36'>36</a>), or at almost any point below this.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the cases I have examined the
insertion of both arms in profile representations
is exceptional. More frequently,
even when action is described, one
arm only is introduced, which may set
out from the anterior surface of the trunk,
or, as we have seen, start from the posterior surface and cross
the trunk (see above, pp. 353, 356, Figs. 23 <a href='#fig23a'>(<i>a</i>)</a> and 26 <a href='#fig26c'>(<i>c</i>)</a>).
In most cases where no action such as walking and holding
a cane is signified both arms are omitted. The uncertainty
of the arms is hardly less here than in the front view.</p>

<p class='c001'>With respect to the legs, we find, as in the primitive
frontal view, an insertion of both. An ordinary child can
still less represent a human figure in profile with only one
leg showing than he can represent it with only one eye.
As a rule, so long as he is guided by his own inner light
only he does not attempt to draw one leg over and partially
covering the other, but sets them both out distinctly at a
respectful distance one from the other. The refinement of
making the second foot or calf and foot peep out from
behind the first, as in Fig. 29 <a href='#fig29a'>(<i>a</i>)</a> (p. 359), and possibly also
Fig. 18 <a href='#fig18c'>(<i>c</i>)</a> (p. 349), shows either an exceptional artistic eye,
or the interference of the preceptor.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Fig. 37.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The treatment of the feet by the childish pencil is
interesting. It is presumable that at first no difference
of profile and front view attaches to the position of the
foot. It has to be shown, and as the young artist knows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>nothing of perspective and foreshortening, and, moreover,
would not be satisfied with that mode of delineation if
he could accomplish it, he proceeds naturally enough to
draw the member as a line at right angles to that of the leg.
This is done in one of two ways, in opposed directions
outwards, or in the same direction, answering to what we
should call the front or the side view. At first, I believe,
no significance of front and side view is attached to these
arrangements. Thus in some sketches by a little girl of
four and a half I find the primitive front view of the head
combined with each of these arrangements of the foot.
In drawings, too, of older children of six and upwards I
have met with cases both of a profile
representation of head and trunk with
spread-eagle feet, as also of a side view
of the feet with a front face (see Figs.
5 <a href='#fig5a'>(<i>a</i>)</a> and 13 <a href='#fig13c'>(<i>c</i>)</a>, pp. 339, 345). This
last arrangement, I find, appears in a
profile treatment of the whole leg and
foot among the drawings of North
American Indians (Fig. <a href='#fig37'>37</a>); and this
suggests that the side view in which the
two feet point one way is more easily reached and fixed by
the untutored draughtsman.</p>

<div id='fig38'  class='figright id004'>
<img src='images/i_p365_38.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>Fig. 38.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>A regular and apparently intelligent
addition of the side view of the feet to the
child’s crude profile drawing of the human
figure produces a noticeable increase of
definiteness. One common arrangement,
I find, in the handling of the profile is the
combination of the side view of the feet
with a more or less consistent profile view
of the head, while the bust is drawn in
front view (see above, Figs. 35 <a href='#fig35a'>(<i>a</i>)</a>, <a href='#fig36'>36</a>). The
effect is of course greater where the side
view of the bent leg is added (see Fig. <a href='#fig38'>38</a> and compare with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>this Fig. <a href='#fig37'>37</a>). I find a liking for this same arrangement in
the drawings of the unskilled adult. An example may be
seen in a drawing by an English carpenter in General Pitt-Rivers’
Museum at Farnham. In the pictographs of the
North American Indians we meet with cases of a similar
treatment.<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c011'><sup>[266]</sup></a> In the drawings on the Egyptian Mummy
cases in the British Museum instances of a precisely similar
treatment are to be found. We seem to have here a sort
of transition from the first crude impossible conception to
a more naturalistic and truthful conception. This twist of
the trunk does not shock the eye with an absolutely impossible
posture, as the early artistic solecisms shock it, and
it is an arrangement which displays much that is characteristic
and valuable in the human form.<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c011'><sup>[267]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>One point to be noticed among these drawings of the
profile by children is that in a large majority of cases the
figure looks to the left of the spectator. In the drawings
which I have examined this appears like a rule to which
there is scarcely any exception, save where the child
wants to make two figures face one another in order to
represent a fight or the less sensational incident of a salute.
The way in which the new direction of the figure is given
in these cases shows that children are not absolutely shut
up to the one mode of representation by any insuperable
difficulty. There is a like tendency observable in the treatment
of the quadruped, which nearly always looks to the
left. It may be added that a similar habit prevails in the
drawings of untutored adults, as the pictographs of the
North American Indians. The explanation of this, as well as
of other generalisations here reached, will be touched on
later.</p>

<p class='c001'>I conceive, then, that there reveals itself in children’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>drawings of the human figure between the ages of three or
four and eight a process of development involving differentiation
and specialisation. This process, instead of leading
to a fuller and more detailed treatment of the front view,
moves in the direction of a new and quasi-profile representation,
although few children arrive at a clear and consistent
profile scheme. Different children appear to find their way
to different modifications of a mixed front and side view,
some amazingly raw, others less so according to the degree
of natural intelligence, and probably also the amount of
good example put in their way by drawings in books, and
still more by model-drawings of mother or other instructor.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have met with only a few examples of a contemporaneous
and discriminative use of front view and profile.
Here and there, it is true, one may light on a case of the
old lunar scheme surviving side by side with the commoner
mixed scheme; but this sporadic survival of an earlier form
does not prove clear discrimination. In the case of one boy
of five the two forms were clearly distinguished, but this child
was from a cultured family, and had presumably enjoyed
some amount of home guidance. In the case of the rougher
and less sophisticated class of children it appears to be a
general rule that the draughtsman settles down to some
one habitual way of drawing the human face and figure,
which can be seen to run through all his drawings, with
only this difference, that some are made more complete
than others by the addition of mouth, arms, etc. Even the
fact of the use of one or two eyes by the same child at the
same date does not appear to me to point to a clear distinction
in his mind between a front and side view. The
omissions in these cases may more readily be explained as
the result of occasional fatigue and carelessness, or, in some
cases, of want of room, or as indicating the point of transition
from an older and cruder to a later and more complete
scheme of profile. This conclusion is supported by the
fact that a child of six or seven, when asked to draw from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>the life, will give the same scheme, whether the model
presents a front or a side view. This has been observed
by M. Passy in the drawings of himself which he obtained
from his own children, by General Pitt-Rivers in the
drawings of uneducated adults, and by others. We may
say, then, that children left to themselves are disposed each
to adopt some single stereotyped mode of representing the
human figure which happens to please his fancy.<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c011'><sup>[268]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In this naïve childish art of profile drawing we have
something which at first seems far removed from the art of
uncivilised races. No doubt, as Grosse urges, the drawings
of savages discovered in North America, Africa, Australia, are
technically greatly superior to children’s clumsy impossible
performances. Yet points of contact disclose themselves.
If a North American Indian is incapable of producing the
stupid scheme of a front view of the mouth and side view of
the nose, he may, as we have seen, occasionally succumb to
the temptation to bring both eyes into a profile drawing.
We may see, too, how in trying to represent action, and to
exhibit the active limb as he must do laterally, the untutored
nature-man is apt to get odd results, as may be observed in
the accompanying drawing by a North American Indian of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>a man shooting (Fig. 39 <a href='#fig39a'>(<i>a</i>)</a>).<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c011'><sup>[269]</sup></a> This may be compared with
the accompanying Egyptian drawing (Fig. 39 <a href='#fig39b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>).<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c011'><sup>[270]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>I have already touched on the modifications which appear
in a child’s drawing of the human figure when the
sculpturesque attitude of repose gives place to the dramatic
attitude of
action. This
transition to the
representation
of action marks
the substitution
of a more realistic
concrete
treatment for
the early abstract
symbolic
treatment. Very
amusing are some of the devices by which a child tries to
indicate this. As Ricci has pointed out, the arm will sometimes
be curved in order to make it reach, say, the face
of an adversary (Fig. 40 <a href='#fig40a'>(<i>a</i>)</a>). A similar introduction of
curvature appears in the accompanying drawing from a scalp
inscription (Fig. 40 <a href='#fig40b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>). Sometimes a curious symbolism
appears, as if to eke out the deficiencies of the artist’s technical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>resources, as when a boy of five represents the junction of
two persons’ hands by connecting them with a line (Fig.
40 <a href='#fig40c'>(<i>c</i>)</a>).<a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c011'><sup>[271]</sup></a> With this may be compared the well-known
device of indicating the direction of sight by drawing a line
from the eye to the object.<a id='r272' /><a href='#f272' class='c011'><sup>[272]</sup></a> The most impossible attitudes
occur when new positions of the legs are attempted, as in
the accompanying endeavours to draw the act of running,
kneeling to play marbles, and kicking a football (Fig. 40
<a href='#fig40d'>(<i>d</i>)</a>, <a href='#fig40e'>(<i>e</i>)</a>, and <a href='#fig40f'>(<i>f</i>)</a>).</p>

<p class='c001'>One other point needs to be referred to before we leave
the human figure, <i>viz.</i>, the treatment of accessories. As
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>pointed out, the child when left to himself is for the most
part oblivious of dress, though the triangular cape-like form
of the body may be a rude attempt
to delineate a clothed figure. In
general he cares merely to crown
his figure with the hat of dignity,
and, at most, to ornament the body
with a row of buttons. Even when
he grows sophisticated and attempts
clothes he still shows his primitive
respect for the natural frame. A
well-known anthropologist tells me
that his little boy on watching his
mother draw a lady insisted on her
putting in the legs before shading
in the petticoats. In General Pitt-Rivers’ collection there
is a drawing by a boy of ten which in clothing the figure
naïvely indicates the limbs through their covering (Fig. <a href='#fig41'>41</a>).
This agrees with what Von den Steinen tells us of the way
the Brazilian Indians drew him and his companions.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet the artificial culture which children in the better
classes of a civilised community are wont to receive is apt
to develop a precocious
respect for raiment, and
this respect is reflected in
their drawings. The early
introduction of buttons has
been illustrated above. One
boy of six was so much in
love with these that he
covered the bust with them
(Fig. 42 <a href='#fig42a'>(<i>a</i>)</a>). Girls are
wont to lay great emphasis
on the lady’s feathered hat
and parasol, as in the accompanying drawing by a maiden
of six (Fig. 42 <a href='#fig42b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>). Throughout this use of apparel in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>crude stage of child-art we see the desire to characterise
sex, rank, and office, as when the man is given his hat, the
soldier his military cap, and so forth. This applies, too,
of course, to such frequent accessories as the walking-stick
(or less frequently the whip, as in Fig. 35 <a href='#fig35b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>, p. 363) and
the pipe, each of which is made the most of in giving
manliness of look. The pipe, it may be added, figures
bravely in a drawing of a European by one of Von den
Steinen’s Brazilians.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><i>First Drawings of Animals.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Many of the characteristics observable in the child’s
treatment of the human figure reappear in his mode of
representing animal forms. This domain of child-art
follows quickly on the first. Children’s interest in animals,
especially quadrupeds, leads them to draw them at an
early stage. In prescribed exercises, moreover, the cat and
the duck appear to figure amongst the earliest models. An
example of this early attempt to draw animals has been
given above (p. 334, Fig. <a href='#fig1'>1</a>).</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Fig. 43 (<i>a</i>).—A duck.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The first crude attempts about the age
of three or four to draw animal forms
exhibit great incompleteness of conception
and want of a sense of position and proportion.
In one case the head seems to be
drawn, but no body—if, indeed, head and
body are not confused; and in others where
a differentiation of head and trunk is
attempted there is no clear local separation,
or if this is attempted there is no clear
indication of the mode of connexion (see,
for example, Fig. 43 <a href='#fig43a'>(<i>a</i>)</a>). In the case of
animals the side view is for obvious reasons
hit on from the first. But, needless to say,
there is no clear representation of the profile head. As
a rule we have the front view, or at least the insertion of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>the two eyes. Both eyes appear in Mr. Cooke’s illustrations
of drawings of the cat by children between three and
four (Fig. 43 <a href='#fig43b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>), as also commonly in drawings of horses.
The position of the eyes is often odd enough, these organs
being in one drawing by a boy of five pushed up into the
ears (Fig. 43 <a href='#fig43c'>(<i>c</i>)</a>).<a id='r273' /><a href='#f273' class='c011'><sup>[273]</sup></a> The front view of the animal head
along with profile body appears occasionally in savage
drawings also.<a id='r274' /><a href='#f274' class='c011'><sup>[274]</sup></a> In some of children’s drawings we see
traces of a mixed scheme. Thus I have a drawing by a
boy of five in which a front view is reached by a kind of
doubling of the profile (Fig. 43 <a href='#fig43d'>(<i>d</i>)</a>).</p>

<p class='c001'>More remarkable than all, perhaps,
we have in one case a clear
instance of the scheme of the
human face, the features, eyes, nose,
and mouth being arranged horizontally
to suit the new circumstances (Fig. 44 <a href='#fig44a'>(<i>a</i>)</a>). With
this may be compared the accompanying transference of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>the animal ear to the human figure, though this suggests—especially
in view of the pipe—a bit of jocosity on the part
of the young draughtsman (Fig. 44 <a href='#fig44b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>).</p>

<p class='c001'>The forms of both head and trunk vary greatly. In a
few drawings I have found the extreme of abstract treatment
in the drawing of the trunk, <i>viz.</i>, by means of a
single line, a device which, so far as I have observed, is
only resorted to in the case of the human figure for the
neck and the limbs. An example of this was given above
in Fig. <a href='#fig1'>1</a> (p. 334). The following drawing of a dog by a
little girl between five and six years old illustrates the same
thing (Fig. 44 <a href='#fig44c'>(<i>c</i>)</a>).<a id='r275' /><a href='#f275' class='c011'><sup>[275]</sup></a> On the other hand we see sometimes a
tendency to give the trunk abnormal thickness, as if the
model used had been the wooden toy-horse, as in the
accompanying drawing by a boy of five (Fig. 44 <a href='#fig44d'>(<i>d</i>)</a>).
Rectilinear instead of rounded forms occur, and the head
is often triangular, these rectilinear contours being probably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>suggested by the teacher in his model schemes (see Fig.
44 <a href='#fig44e'>(<i>e</i>)</a>).</p>

</div>
</div>

</div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The legs are of course
all visible. The strangest
inattention to number betrays
itself here. As we
saw, a child in beginning
his scribble-drawing piles on lines for the legs (see above,
p. 334, Fig. <a href='#fig1'>1</a>). A girl between three and four years
of age endowed a cat with two legs and a bird with
three (see Fig. 45 <a href='#fig45a'>(<i>a</i>)</a> and <a href='#fig45b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>).<a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c011'><sup>[276]</sup></a>  A boy in his sixth
year drew a quadruped with ten legs (Fig. 45 <a href='#fig45c'>(<i>c</i>)</a>).
They are often drawn absurdly out of position. In more
than one case I find them crowded behind, as in the
accompanying drawing of some quadruped by the same
little girl that drew the cat and the bird, and in a drawing
of a mouse by another child about the same age, viz.,
three and a half years (Fig. 45 <a href='#fig45d'>(d)</a> and <a href='#fig45e'>(e)</a>). They commonly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>remain apart from one another throughout their
course, following roughly a parallel direction. But this
simple scheme is soon modified, first of all by enlarging
the space between the fore and the hind legs, and then by
introducing some change of direction answering to the look
of the animal in motion. This is most easily effected by
making the fore and the hind pair diverge downwards, as in
Fig. 43 <a href='#fig43b'>(<i>b</i>)</a> and <a href='#fig43c'>(<i>c</i>)</a> (p. 373). In rarer cases the divergence
appears between the two legs of the fore and of the hind pair
(Fig. 45 <a href='#fig45f'>(<i>f</i>)</a>). The knee-bend is early introduced as a
means of suggesting motion. Either the legs are all bent
backwards, as in Fig. 45 <a href='#fig45g'>(<i>g</i>)</a> (<i>cf.</i> above, Fig. 44 <a href='#fig44e'>(<i>e</i>)</a>);
or, with what looks like a perverted feeling for symmetry,
each pair is bent inwardly, as in Fig. 45 <a href='#fig45h'>(<i>h</i>)</a>. The
forms are often extraordinary enough, a preternatural
thickness of leg being not infrequently given, and the knee-joint
occasionally taking on grotesque shapes as if the little
draughtsman had just been attending a class on the anatomy
of the skeleton. The hoof is drawn in a still freer manner,
various designs, as the bird-foot, the circle, and the looped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>pattern, appearing here as in the case of the human foot
(Fig. 45 <a href='#fig45i'>(<i>i</i>)</a> and <a href='#fig45j'>(<i>j</i>)</a>; <i>cf.</i> Figs. 43 <a href='#fig43c'>(<i>c</i>)</a> and 44 <a href='#fig44a'>(<i>a</i>)</a> (p. 373)).</p>

<p class='c001'>In this unlearned attempt to draw animal forms the
child falls far below the level of the untutored savage. The
drawings of animals by the North American Indians, by
Africans, and others, have been justly praised for their
artistic excellence. A fine perception of form is, in many
cases, at least, clearly recognisable, the due covering of one
part by another is represented, and movement is vigorously
suggested. Lover though he is of animals, the child, when
compared with the uncivilised adult, shows himself to be
woefully ignorant of his pets.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><i>Men on Horseback, etc.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Childish drawing moves as the dialectic progress of
the Hegelian thought from distinction and antithesis to a
synthesis or unity which embraces the distinction. After
illustrating the human biped in his contradistinction to the
quadruped he proceeds to combine them in a higher
artistic unity, the man on horseback. The special interest
of this department of childish drawing lies in the fresh and
genial manner of the combining. To draw a man and a
horse apart is one thing, to fit the two figures one to the
other, quite another.</p>

<p class='c001'>At first the degree of connexion is slight. There is no
suggestion of a composite or mixed animal, such as may
have suggested to the lively Greek imagination the myth
of the centaur. The human figure is pitched on to the
quadruped in the most unceremonious fashion. Thus in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>many cases there is no attempt even to combine the profile
aspects, the man appearing impudently in frontal aspect, or
what would be so but for the
lateral nasal excrescence, as in
the accompanying drawing by a
boy of five (Fig. <a href='#fig46'>46</a>).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>With this indifference to a
consistent profile there goes
amazing slovenliness in attaching
the man to the animal, and this
whether the front or side view of
the human figure is introduced.
No attempt is made in many
cases to show attachment: the
man is drawn just above the quadruped, that is all. It
seems to be a chance whether the two figures meet,
whether the feet of the man rest circus-fashion on the
animal’s back, or, lastly, whether the human form is drawn
in part over the animal, and, if so, at what height it is to
emerge from the animal’s back. Various arrangements occur
in the same sheet of drawings (see Fig. 47 <a href='#fig47a'>(<i>a</i>)</a>, <a href='#fig47b'>(<i>b</i>)</a> and <a href='#fig47c'>(<i>c</i>)</a>).</p>

<p class='c001'>When this overlapping takes place the presence of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>animal’s trunk makes no difference in the treatment of the
man. He is drawn with his two legs just as if he were in
relief against the horse; and this arrangement is apt to
persist even when a child can draw a rude semblance of a
horse and knows at what level to place the rider. So difficult
to the little artist is this idea of one thing covering another
that even when he comes to know that both the legs of the
rider are not seen, he may get confused and erase both (see
above (p. 376), Fig. 45 <a href='#fig45f'>(<i>f</i>)</a>).<a id='r277' /><a href='#f277' class='c011'><sup>[277]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The savage is in general as much above the child in the
representation of the rider as he is in that of the animal
apart. Yet traces of similar confusion do undoubtedly
appear. Von den Steinen says that
his Brazilians drew the rider with both legs
showing. Andree gives an illustration,
among the stone-carvings (petroglyphs) of
savages, of the employment of a front view of the human
figure rising above the horse with no legs showing below (Fig.
48 <a href='#fig48a'>(<i>a</i>)</a>).<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c011'><sup>[278]</sup></a> Even among the drawings of the North American
Indians, in which the horse is in general so well outlined, we
occasionally find what appear to be the germs of confusions
similar to those of the child. Thus Schoolcraft gives among
drawings from an inscription on a
buffalo skin one in which we have above
the profile view of a horse the front view
of a man, with arms stretched out laterally
while the legs are wanting.<a id='r279' /><a href='#f279' class='c011'><sup>[279]</sup></a> A
clearer case of confusion is supplied by
the following drawing, also by a North

those of the rider’s legs (Fig. 48 <a href='#fig48b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>).<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c011'><sup>[280]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The same tendency to show the whole man where the
circumstances hide a part appears in children’s drawings
of a man in a boat, a railway carriage and so forth. Ricci
has shown that the different ways in which the child-artist
puts a human figure in a boat are as numerous as those
in which he sets it on a horse. The figure may stand out
above the boat or overlap, in which last case it may be cut
across by the deck-line and its lower part shown, or be
clapped wholly below the deck, or again be half immersed
in the water below the boat, or, lastly, where an attempt
to respect fact is made, be truncated, the trunk appearing
through the side of the boat, though the legs are wanting.<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c011'><sup>[281]</sup></a>

totality (Fig. 49 <a href='#fig49a'>(<i>a</i>)</a> and <a href='#fig49b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>). It is much the same thing
when a child flattens out a house or other object so as to
show us its three sides, that is to say one which in reality
is hidden (Fig. 49 <a href='#fig49c'>(<i>c</i></a>) and <a href='#fig49d'>(<i>d</i>)</a>). With these habits of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>child may be compared those of the savage. The impulse
to show everything, even what is covered, is illustrated in
a drawing of a singer in his wigwam by an Indian (Fig. 49
<a href='#fig49e'>(<i>e</i>)</a>).<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c011'><sup>[282]</sup></a> Even where colour comes in and one
thing has to be hidden by a part of another
thing the savage artist, like the child insists
on drawing the whole. This is illustrated in
a curious custom, the drawing of two serpents
(in dry, coloured powder) by North American
fire-dancers. They are drawn across one
another, and the artist has first to draw completely the
one partly covered, and then the second over the first.<a id='r283' /><a href='#f283' class='c011'><sup>[283]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The child’s drawing of the house, though less remarkable
than that of the man and the quadruped, has a certain
interest. It illustrates, as we have just seen, not merely
his determination to render visible what is hidden, but
also his curious feeling for
position and proportion.
In one case I found that
in the desire to display
the contents of a house a
girl of six had actually
set a table between the
chimneys. The accompanying
drawing done by
the boy C. at the age of
five years five months
illustrates the fine childish contempt for proportion (Fig.
<a href='#fig50'>50</a>). A curious feature in these drawings of the house is
the care bestowed on certain details, pre-eminently the
window. This is even a more important characteristic
feature than the chimney with its loops of smoke. Some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>children give a quite loving care to the window, drawing
the lace curtains, the flowers, and so forth.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><i>Résumé of Facts.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>We may now sum up the main results of our study.
We find in the drawings of untrained children from about
the age of three to that of eight or ten a curious mode of
dealing with the most familiar forms. At no stage of
this child-art can we find what we should regard as elements
of artistic value: yet it has its quaint and its suggestive
side.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first thing that strikes us here is that this child-delineation,
crude and bizarre as it is, illustrates a process
of development. Thus we have (<i>a</i>) the stage of vague
formless scribble, (<i>b</i>) that of primitive design, typified by
what I have called the lunar scheme of the human face,
and (<i>c</i>) that of a more sophisticated treatment of the human
figure, as well as of animal forms.</p>

<p class='c001'>This process of art-evolution has striking analogies
with that of organic evolution. It is clearly a movement
from the vague or indefinite to the definite, a process of
gradual specialisation. Not only so, we may note that it
begins with the representation of those rounded or ovoid
contours which seem to constitute the basal forms of animal
organisms, and proceeds like organic evolution by a gradual
differentiation of the ‘homogeneous’ structure through the
addition of detailed parts or organs. These organs in their
turn gradually assume their characteristic forms. It is,
perhaps, worth observing here that some of the early drawings
of animals are strongly suggestive of embryo forms
(compare, <i>e.g.</i>, Fig. 45 <a href='#fig45b'>(<i>b</i>)</a> and <a href='#fig45d'>(<i>d</i>)</a>, p. 375).</p>

<p class='c001'>If now we examine this early drawing on its representative
side we find that it is crude and defective enough. It
proceeds by giving a bare outline of the object, with at
most one or two details thrown in. The form neither of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>the whole nor of the parts is correctly rendered. Thus in
drawing the foot it is enough for the child to indicate the
angle: the direction of the foot-line is comparatively immaterial.
In this respect a child’s drawing differs from
a truly artistic sketch or suggestive indication by a few
characteristic lines, which is absolutely correct so far as it
goes. The child is content with a schematic treatment,
which involves an appreciable and even considerable departure
from truthful representation. Thus the primitive
lunar drawing of the human face is manifestly rather a
diagrammatic scheme than an imitative representation of a
concrete form.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this non-imitative and merely indicative treatment
there is room for all sorts of technical inaccuracies. Form
is woefully misapprehended, as in the circular trunk, the
oblong mouth, the claw foot, and so forth. Proportion—even
in its simple aspect of equality—is treated with contempt
in many instances (<i>cf.</i> the legs of the quadruped
and the bird in Fig. 45 <a href='#fig45a'>(<i>a</i>)</a>, <a href='#fig45b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>, and <a href='#fig45c'>(<i>c</i>)</a> (p. 375)). What
is no less important, division of space and relative
position of parts, which seem vital even to a diagrammatic
treatment, are apt to be overlooked, as in drawing
the facial features high up, in attaching the arms to the
head, and so forth. Even the element of number is made
light of, and this, too, in such simple circumstances as when
drawing the legs of an animal.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Fig. 51 (<i>a</i>).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>One of the most curious of these misrepresentations
comes into view in the third or sophisticated stage, <i>viz.</i>, the
introduction of more than is visible. This error, again,
assumes a milder and a graver form, <i>viz.</i>, (<i>a</i>) the giving of
the features more distinctly and completely than they appear
in the object represented, and (<i>b</i>) the introducing of features
which have no place in the object represented. Examples
of the first are the introduction of the nasal angle into the
front view of the human face; the separation throughout
their length of the four legs of the horse; and such odd
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>tricks as detaching the reins of the horse from the animal,
as in Fig. 51 <a href='#fig51a'>(<i>a</i>)</a>. Illustrations of the second are numerous
and varied. They include
first of all the
naïve introduction of
features of an object
which are not on the
spectator’s side and so
in view, as the second
eye and the second arm
in what are predominantly
profile representations.
With these may be classed the attempt to
exhibit three sides of a house. Closely related to these
errors of perspective is the exposure of objects or parts of
objects which are covered by others. It is possible that the
spread-eagle arrangement of the two joined arms is an
attempt to represent a feature of childish anatomy, <i>viz.</i>, the
idea that the arms run through and join in the middle of
the trunk. A clearer example of this attempt to expose to
view what is covered is the exhibition of the whole human
figure in a boat, house or
carriage. With this may
be compared the disclosure
of the whole head of a
horse when drinking, as in
the accompanying drawing
by a boy of five (Fig. 51 <a href='#fig51b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>), of the whole head of the
man through his hat (see above, p. 350, Fig. 20 <a href='#fig20b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>), and
of the human limbs through the clothes (Fig. <a href='#fig41'>41</a>, p. 371).</p>

<div id='fig51b'  class='figleft id015'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>Fig. 51 (<i>b</i>).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>A class of confusions, having a certain similarity to some
of these, consists in the transference of the features of one
object to a second, as when a man or quadruped is given a
bird-like foot (Figs. 7 <a href='#fig7d'>(<i>d</i>)</a> and 43 <a href='#fig43c'>(<i>c</i>)</a>, pp. 342, 373), and still
more manifestly when the facial scheme of the man is transferred
to the quadruped or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vice versâ</i></span> (Fig. 44 <a href='#fig44a'>(<i>a</i>)</a> and <a href='#fig44b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>,
pp. 373, 374).</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>These last errors clearly illustrate the tendency to a conventional
treatment, a tendency which, as I have observed
already, runs through children’s spontaneous drawings.
This free conventional handling of natural forms has been
illustrated in the habitual drawing of the mouth and eyes,
and still more strikingly in that of the hands and feet.</p>

<p class='c001'>Paradoxical though it may seem, these drawings, while
in general bare and negligent of details, show in certain
directions a quite amusing attention to them. Thus, we
find at a very early stage certain details, as the pipe of
the man, insisted on with extravagant emphasis; and may
observe at a somewhat later stage in the elaborate drawing
of hair, buttons, parasol, and so forth, a tendency to give
some feature to which the child attaches value a special
prominence and degree of completeness.</p>

<p class='c001'>The art of children is a thing by itself, and must not
straight away be classed with the rude art of the untrained
adult. As adult, the latter has knowledge and technical
resources above those of the little child; and these points of
superiority show themselves, for example, in the fine delineation
of animal forms by Africans and others.<a id='r284' /><a href='#f284' class='c011'><sup>[284]</sup></a> At the same
time, after allowing for these differences, it is, I think, incontestable
that a number of characteristic traits in children’s
drawings are reflected in those of untutored savages.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><i>Explanation of Facts.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Let us now see how we are to explain these characteristics.
In order to do so we must try to understand what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>process a child’s mind goes through when he draws something,
and to compare this with what passes in the mind of
an adult artist. The problem has, it is evident, to do with
drawing from memory or out of one’s head, for though the
child may begin to draw by help of models, he develops his
characteristic art in complete independence of these.</p>

<p class='c001'>In order to draw an object from memory two things
are obviously necessary. We must have at the outset an
idea of the form we wish to represent, and this visual image
of the form must somehow translate itself into a series of
manual movements corresponding to its several parts. In
other words, it presupposes both an initial conception and
a correlated process of execution.</p>

<p class='c001'>In psychological language this correlation or co-ordination
between the idea of a form and the carrying out of the
necessary movements of the hand is expressed by saying
that the visual image, say, of the curve of the full face, calls
up the associated image of the manual movement. This
last, again, may mean either the visual image of the hand
executing the required movement, or the image of the muscular
sensations experienced when the arm is moved in the
required way, or possibly both of these.</p>

<p class='c001'>The process of drawing a whole form is of course more
complex than this, each step in the operation being adjusted
to preceding steps. How far the movements of the draughtsman’s
hands are guided here by a visual image of the form,
which remains present throughout, how far by attention to
what has already been set down, may not be quite certain.
Judging from my own case, I should describe the process
somewhat after this fashion. In drawing a human face we
set out with a visual image of the whole, which is incomplete
in respect of details, but represents roughly size and
general form or outline. This image is projected indistinctly
and unsteadily, of course, on the sheet of paper before us,
and this projected image controls the whole operation. But
as we advance we pay more and more attention to the visual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>presentation supplied by the portion of the drawing already
produced, and only realise with any distinctness that part
of the projected visual image which is just in advance of the
pencil.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is evident that the carrying out of such a prolonged
operation involves a perfected mechanism of eye, brain and
hand connexions; for much of the manual adjustment is
instantaneous and sub-conscious. At the same time the
process illustrates a very high measure of volitional control
or concentration. Unless we keep the original design fixed
before us, and attend at each stage to the relations of the
executed to the unexecuted part, we are certain to go wrong.</p>

<p class='c001'>Practice tends, of course, to reduce the conscious element
in the process. In the case of a person accustomed to draw
the outline of a human head, a cat or what not, the operation
is very much one of hand-memory into which visual
representations enter only faintly. The movements follow
one another of themselves without the intervention of distinct
visual images (whether that of the linear form or of
the moving hand). There is an approach here to what
happens when we put last year’s date to a letter, the hand
following out an old habit.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now the child has to acquire the co-ordinations here
briefly described. He may have the visual image of the
human face or the horse which he wishes to depict. This
power of visualising shows itself in other ways and can be
independently tested, as by asking a child to describe the
object verbally. But he has as yet no inkling of how to
reproduce his image. That his inability at the outset is
due to a want of co-ordination is seen in the fact that
at this stage he cannot draw even when a model is before
his eyes.</p>

<p class='c001'>The process of learning here is very like what takes
place when a child learns to speak. The required movements
have somehow to be performed and attached to the
effects they are then found to produce. Just as a child
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>first produces sounds, partly instinctively or spontaneously,
partly by imitating the seen movements of another’s lips,
etc., so he produces lines by play-like scribble and by
imitating the visible movements of another person’s hand.
The tendency to imitate is observable in the first loop-formations,
and possibly also in the abrupt angular changes
which give a zig-zag look to some of these early tracings.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this early stage we see a marked want of control.
The effort is spasmodic and short-lived: the little draughtsman
presently runs off into nonsense scribble. The want
of control is seen, too, in the tendency to prolong lines
unduly, and to repeat or multiply them, the primitive play-movements
being very much under the empire of inertia or
habit, <i>i.e.</i>, the tendency to repeat or go on with an action.
The effect of limitating natural conditions in the motor
apparatus is illustrated, not only in the slightly curved form
of these first scribble lines, but in the general obliquity or
inclination of the line; it being manifestly easier for the
hand when brought in front of the body to describe a line
running slightly upwards from left to right (or in the
reverse direction) than one running horizontally. The want
of control by means of a steady visual image is further seen
in the absence of any attempt at a plan, at a mapping out
of the available space, and at an observation of proportion.</p>

<p class='c001'>It might be thought that, though a child at this inexperienced
stage were unable to produce the correct form of
a familiar object, he would at once detect the incorrectness
of the one he sets down. No doubt, if he were in the attitude
of cold critical observation, he would do so: in fact,
as Mr. Cooke and others have shown, he sees the absurdities
of his workmanship as soon as they are pointed out to him.
But when drawing he is in another sort of mood, akin to
that imaginative mood in which he traces forms in the
plaster of the ceiling, or in the letters of his spelling-book.
He means to draw a man or a horse, and consequently the
formless jumble of lines becomes, to his fancy, a man or a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>horse. His first drawings are thus, in a sense, playthings,
which, like the battered stump of a doll, his imaginative
intention corrects, supplements, and perfects.</p>

<p class='c001'>With repetition, and that amount of supervision and
guidance which most children who take a pencil in hand
manage to get from somebody, he begins to note the actual
character of his line-effects, and to associate these with the
movements which produce them. A straight horizontal
line, a curved line returning upon itself, and so forth, come
to be differentiated, and to be co-ordinated with their
respective manual movements.</p>

<p class='c001'>We may now pass to the second stage, the beginning of
true linear representation, as illustrated in the first abstract
schematic treatment of the human face and figure.</p>

<p class='c001'>A question arises at the very outset here as to whether,
and if so to what extent, children re-discover this method
of representation for themselves. Here, as in the case of
child-language, such as ‘bow-wow,’ ‘gee-gee,’ tradition and
example undoubtedly play their part. A parent, or an
older brother and sister, in setting the first models, is pretty
certain to adopt a simple scheme, as that of the lunar face;
and even where there is no instruction a child is quick at
imitating other children’s manner of drawing. Yet this does
not affect the contention that such manner of drawing is
eminently childish, that is, the one a child finds his way to
most readily, any more than the fact of the nurse’s calling
the horse ‘gee-gee’ in talking to baby affects the contention
that ‘gee-gee’ is eminently a baby-name.</p>

<p class='c001'>The scanty abstract treatment, the circle enclosing two
dots and the vertical and horizontal lines, points to the
absence of any serious attempt to imitate a form closely
and fully. It seems absurd to suppose that a child of three
or four does not image a human face better than he delineates
it; and even if this were doubtful it is certain that when
he sets down a man without hair, ears, trunk, or arm, his
execution is falling far short of his knowledge. How is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>this to be accounted for? My explanation is that the little
artist is still much more of a symbolist than a naturalist,
that he does not in the least care about a full and close
likeness, but wants only a barely sufficient indication. This
scantiness of treatment issuing from want of the more serious
artistic intention is of course supported by technical limitations.
The lunar face with the two propping lines answers
to what the child can do easily and comfortably. Much
more than his elder brethren our small limner is bound by
the law of artistic economy, the need of producing his
effects with the smallest expenditure of labour, and of
making every touch tell.</p>

<p class='c001'>Defects of executive resource and of manual skill
appear plainly in other characteristics. The common inclination
of the lines of the legs points to the unconscious selection
of easiest directions of manual movement.<a id='r285' /><a href='#f285' class='c011'><sup>[285]</sup></a> The unduly
lengthened arm and leg, the multiplication of legs—as seen
most strikingly in the case of the quadruped—illustrate the
influence of motor or muscular inertia. There is, too,
a noticeable want of measurement and management of the
space to be covered, as when one eye is put in so large
as to leave no room for a second, or when filling in details
from above downwards the eyes are put in too near the
occipital curve, and so all the features set too high up.
The same want of measurement of space may contribute to
the child’s habit of drawing the trunk so absurdly small in
proportion to the head; for he begins with the head, and
by making this large finds he has not left, within the limits
of what he considers the right size of figure, space enough
for the trunk.</p>

<p class='c001'>Very noticeable is the influence of habit in this
abstract treatment. By habit I here mean hand-memory,
or the tendency to combine movements in the old ways,
though this is commonly aided, as we shall see, by “association
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>of ideas”. Thus a child falls into a stereotyped
way of drawing the human face and figure; line follows
line in the accustomed sequence; the only variation
showing itself is in the insertion or omission of nose, ears,
or arms; these uncertainties being due to fluctuations of
energy and concentration. A child’s art is, in respect of
its unyielding sameness, a striking example of a conservative
conventionality. He gets used to his pencil-forms,
and pronounces them right, to the greater and greater
neglect of their relation to natural forms. Habit shows
itself in other ways too. Notice, for example, how a child,
after adding the trunk, will go on inserting the arms into the
head as he used to do. Such a habit is an affair not only
of the hand but of the eye. The arms have by repeated
delineation come in the art-sphere to belong to the head.</p>

<p class='c001'>Coming now to the more elaborate and sophisticated
stage of five or thereabouts, in which the shape of eyes, mouth,
and nose is shadowed forth, the difficult appendages as hands
and feet attempted, and the profile aspect introduced, we
notice first of all a step in the direction of naturalism. The
child like the race gets tired of his bald primitive symbolism,
and essays to bring more of concrete fulness and life into
his forms. Only this first attempt does not lead to a continued
progress, but stops short at what is rude and arbitrary
enough, substituting merely a second rigid conventionalism
for the first.</p>

<p class='c001'>This transition indicates an advance in technical skill;
hence we find a measure of free and bold invention, as in
the management of the facial features, <i>e.g.</i>, the scissors-shaped
nose, and still more in the treatment of hands and
feet, which is at once exaggerative, as in the big burr
forms, and freely conventional, as in the leaf-pattern for
the hand, and the wondrous loop-designs for the foot.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet though this freer treatment shows a certain technical
advance it illustrates the effect of the limitations of
the child’s executive power. Thus the new partially profile
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>figures are very apt to lean, looking as if they were
falling backwards. It is probable that the wide-spread
tendency to make the profile face look towards the spectator’s
left rather than his right is due to the circumstance that
the eye can much better follow and control the pencil in
this case than in the opposite one. In the latter the hand
is apt to interfere with seeing the line of the face, especially
if the pencil is held near its point.</p>

<p class='c001'>Habit, too, continues to assert its dominion. The
tendency noticeable now and again, even among English
children, to treat the feet after the manner of the hands
illustrates this. Habit is further illustrated in the tendency
to a transference of forms appropriate to the man to the
animal; or, when (owing to the interposition of the instructor)
the drawing of animals
is in advance of the other, in
the reverse process; as when
a cat is drawn with two legs,
or a horse is given a man’s
face, or the human form develops
a horse’s ears, or a
bird’s feet. With these may
be compared the transference of a bird-like body and
tail to a quadruped in Fig. 45 <a href='#fig45i'>(<i>i</i>)</a>, p. 377. The accompanying
two drawings by a child of six show how similar forms are
apt to be used for the man and for the animal (Fig. <a href='#fig52'>52</a>).</p>

<div id='fig52'  class='figleft id013'>
<img src='images/i_p392_52.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='small'>Man.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class='small'>Bird.</span><br />Fig. 52.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But the really noticeable thing in this later sophisticated
treatment is the bringing into view of what in the original
is invisible, as the front view of the eye as well as both eyes
into what otherwise looks a side view of the face, the two
legs of the rider and so forth. Here, no doubt, we may still
trace the influence of technical limitations and of habit. The
influence of the former is seen in the completing of the contour
of the head before or after drawing the hat: for the
child would not know how to start with the lines which form
the commencement of the visible part of the head. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>influence of habit is also recognisable here. A child having
learned first of all to draw the front view of the eye, the
two eyes and the two legs side by side, tends partly as the
result of organised hand-trick, partly in consequence of
‘association of ideas,’ to go on drawing in the same fashion
in the new circumstances. A specially clear illustration of
this effect of habit already alluded to is the introduction of
the front view of the nose in the mixed scheme. These
cases are exactly paralleled by the Egyptian drawing in
which while one shoulder is pulled round the other is left in
square front view (see above, p. 369, Fig. 39 <a href='#fig39b'>(<i>b</i>)</a>). Still, habit
does not account for everything here. It does not, for
example, explain why the child brings into view three sides
of a house. The technical deficiencies of the small draughtsman,
his want of serious artistic purpose, seem an insufficient
explanation of these later sophistries. They appear to point
plainly to certain peculiarities of the process of childish
conception. We are compelled then to inquire a little more
closely into the characteristics of children’s observation
and of their mental representation of objects.</p>

<p class='c001'>We are apt to think that children when they look at
things at all scrutinise them closely, and afterwards imagine
clearly what they have observed. But this assumption is
hardly justified. No doubt they often surprise us by their
attention to small unimportant details of objects, especially
when these are new and odd-looking. But it is a long way
from this to a careful methodic investigation of objects. Children’s
observation is for the most part capriciously selective
and one-sided. They apprehend one or two striking or
especially interesting features and are blind to the rest.
This is fully established in the case of ordinary children by
the wondrous ignorance they display when questioned about
common objects. It is hardly necessary to add that their
spontaneous untrained observation is quite unequal to that
careful analytical attention to form-elements in their
relations which underlies all clear grasp of the direction of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>linear elements, the relative position of the several parts of
a figure, and proportion.</p>

<p class='c001'>This being so it maybe said that defects of observation are
reflected in children’s drawing through all its phases. Thus
the primitive bare schematism of the human face answers
to an incomplete observation and consequently incomplete
mode of imagination, just as it answers to a want of artistic
purpose and to technical incapacity. How far defective
observation assists at this first stage I do not feel sure.
Further experimental inquiries are needed on this point.
I lean to the view already expressed, that at this stage
manual reproduction is far behind visual imagination.</p>

<p class='c001'>When, however, we come on to the delineation of an
object under its different aspects the defects of mental
representation assume a much graver character. We must
bear in mind that a child soon gets beyond the stage of
recalling and imagining the particular look of an object,
say the front view of his mother’s face, or of his house.
He begins as soon as he understands and imitates others’
language to synthesise such pictorial images of particular
visual presentations or appearances into the wholes which
we call ideas of things. A child of four or five thinking of
his father or his house probably recalls in a confused way
disparate and incompatible visual aspects, the front view
as on the whole the most impressive being predominant,
though striking elements of the side view may rise into
consciousness also. With this process of synthesising
aspects into the concrete whole we call a thing there goes
the further process of binding together representations of
this and that thing into generic or typical ideas answering
to man, horse, house, in general. A child of five or six, so
far from being immersed in individual presentations and
concrete objects, as is often supposed, has carried out a
respectable measure of generalisation, and this largely by
the help of language. Thus a ‘man’ reduced to visual
terms has come to mean for him (according to his well-known
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>verbal formula) something with a head, two eyes, etc., etc.,
which he does not need to represent in a mental picture
because the verbal formula serves to connect the features
in his memory.</p>

<p class='c001'>Hence when he comes to draw he has not the artist’s
clear mental vision of the actual look of things to guide
him. He is led not by a lively and clear sensuous imagination,
but by a mass of generalised knowledge embodied in
words, <i>viz.</i>, the logical form of a definition or description.
This, I take it, is the main reason why with such supreme
insouciance he throws into one design features of the full
face and of the profile; for in setting down his linear
scheme he is aiming not at drawing a picture, an imitative
representation of something we could see, but rather at
enumerating, in the new expressive medium which his
pencil supplies, what he knows about the particular thing.
Since he is thus bent on a linear description of what he
knows he is not in the least troubled about the laws of
visual appearance, but setting perspective at naught compels
the spectator to see the other side, to look through one
object at another, and so forth.</p>

<p class='c001'>Since the process at this sophisticated stage is controlled
by knowledge of things as wholes and not by representations
of concrete appearances or views, we can understand
why the visible result does not shock the draughtsman.
The little descriptor does not need to compare the look of
his drawing with that of the real object: it is right as a
description anyhow. How strongly this idea of description
controls his views of pictures has already been pointed out.
Just as he objects to a correct profile drawing as an inadequate
description, so he objects to a drawing of the hind
part of a horse entering the stable, and asks, ‘Where is his
head?’ We may say then that what a lively fancy did in
the earlier play-stages childish logic does now, it blinds the
artist to the actual look of what his pencil has created.</p>

<p class='c001'>Use soon adds its magic force, and the impossible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>combination, the two eyes stuck on at the side of the
profile nose, the two legs of the rider untroubled by the
capacious trunk of the animal which he strides, the man
wholly exposed to view inside the boat or carriage, gets
stereotyped into the right mode of linear description.</p>

<p class='c001'>All this shows that the child’s eye at a surprisingly
early period loses its primal ‘innocence,’ grows ‘sophisticated’
in the sense that instead of seeing what is really
presented it sees, or pretends to see, what knowledge and
logic tell it is there. In other words his sense-perceptions
have for artistic purposes become corrupted by a too large
admixture of intelligence. This corruption is closely
analogous to what we all experience when we lose the
primal simplicity of the eye for colour, and impart into our
‘visual impressions,’ as we call them, elements of memory
and inference, saying, for example, that a distant mountain
side is ‘green’ just because we can make out that it is
grass-covered and know that grass when looked at nearer is
of a green colour.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have dwelt on what from our grown-up standpoint
we must call the defects of children’s drawing. Yet in
bringing this study to a close it is only just to remark that
there are other and better qualities well deserving of recognition.
Crude, defective, self-contradictory even, as
these early designs undoubtedly are, they are not wholly
destitute of artistic qualities. The abstract treatment itself,
in spite of its inadequacy, is after all in the direction
of a true art, which in its essential nature is selective and
suggestive rather than literally reproductive. We may discern,
too, even in these rude schemes a nascent sense of values,
of a selection of what is characteristic. Even the primitive
trunkless form seems to illustrate this, for though, as we
have seen in a previous essay, the trunk plays an important
part in the development of the idea of self, it is for
pictorial purposes less interesting and valuable than the
head. However this be, it is clear that we see this impulse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>of selection at work later on in the addition of the buttons,
the pipe, the stick, the parasol and so forth.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is to be noted, too, that even in these untutored
performances, where convention and tradition exercise so
great a sway, there are faint indications of a freer individual
initiative. Witness, for example, the varying modes of
representing hair, hands, and feet. We may say then that
even rough children in elementary schools who are never
likely to develop artistic talent display a rudiment of art-feeling.
It is only fair to them to testify that in spite of
the limitations of their stiff wooden treatment they express
a certain individuality of feeling and aim, that like true
artists they convey a personal impression. These traits
appear most plainly in the later representations of action,
but they are not altogether absent from the earlier statuesque
figures. Compare, for example, the look of alert vigour in
Fig. 5 <a href='#fig5a'>(<i>a</i>)</a> (p. 339), of grinning impudence in Fig. 6 <a href='#fig6a'>(<i>a</i>)</a>
(p. 341), of provoking ‘cheekiness’ in Fig. 20 <a href='#fig20b'>(<i>b</i>)</a> (p. 350),
of a seedy ‘swagger’ in Fig. <a href='#fig32'>32</a> (p. 362), of inebriate gaiety
in Fig. <a href='#fig17'>17</a> (p. 348), of absurd skittishness in Fig. 24 <a href='#fig24b'>(<i>b</i>)</a> (p.
354), of insane flurry in Fig. 26 <a href='#fig26a'>(<i>a</i>)</a> (p. 355), of Irish easy-goingness
even when somebody has to be killed in Fig. <a href='#Page_34'>34</a>
(p. 363), of wiry resoluteness in Fig. 29 <a href='#fig29a'>(<i>a</i>)</a> (p. 359), of sly
villainy in Fig. <a href='#Page_38'>38</a> (p. 365), and of demure simplicity in Fig.
26 <a href='#fig26c'>(<i>c</i>)</a> (p. 356); and note the delicious variety of equine
character in Fig. 45 <a href='#fig45f'>(<i>f</i>)</a> (p. 376) and following.</p>

<p class='c001'>If a finer æsthetic feeling is developed the first rude
descriptive drawing loses its attractions. A friend, a well-known
psychologist, has observed in the case of his children
that when they try to draw something pretty, <i>e.g.</i>, a beautiful
lady, they abandon their customary mode of description
and become aware of the look of their designs and criticise
them as bad. This seems to me a most significant observation.
It is the feeling for what is beautiful which makes
a child attend closely to the bare look of things, and the
beginning of a finer observation of forms commonly takes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>its rise in this nascent sense of beauty. Indeed, may one
not say that only when a germ of the æsthetic feeling for
beauty arises, and a child falls in love with the mere look of
certain things, can there appear the beginnings of genuinely
artistic work, of a conscientious endeavour to render on
paper the aspect which pleases the eye?</p>

front and a side view, both of which may be used by the same child at
the same time. The former consists of nose and mouth of profile and
eyes and ears of full face, the latter, of nose and mouth of profile
with one eye and one ear; that is to say the two differ only in the
number of eyes and ears (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Revue Philosophique</cite></span>, 1891, p. 614 ff.). It
would be interesting to know on how large an examination this
generalisation is based. As suggested above, the occasional omission
of the second eye and ear where both are commonly used can be
explained without supposing the child to distinguish between profile
and full face. Professor Barnes goes so far as to state with numerical
exactness the relative frequency of profile and full face by children
at different stages. He makes, however, no serious attempt to explain
the criterion by which he would distinguish the two modes of representation
(see his article, <cite>Pedagogical Seminary</cite>, ii., p. 455 ff.).</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>XI. <br /> EXTRACTS FROM A FATHER’S DIARY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>There has just come into my hands a curious document. It
is a sort of diary kept by a father in which he chronicles
certain of the early doings and sayings of his boy. It makes
no pretence to being a regular and methodical register of progress,
such as Mr. F. Galton has shown us how to carry out.
It may be said by way of extenuation that the diary sets out in
the year 1880, that is to say, two years before Professor Preyer
published his model record of an infant’s progress. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>En revanche</i></span>,
it is manifestly the work of a psychologist given to speculation,
and this of a somewhat bold type. In the present paper I
propose to cull from this diary what seem to me some of the
choicer observations and comments on these. If these do not
always come up to the requirements of a rigidly scientific standard
in respect of completeness, precision, and grave impartiality,
they may none the less prove suggestive of serious scientific
thought, while any extravagances of fancy and any levity of
manner may well be set down to the play of a humorous
sentiment, which betrays the father beneath the observer.</p>

<p class='c001'>I may begin my sketch of the early history of this boy by
remarking that he appears to have been a normal and satisfactory
specimen of his class,—healthy, good-natured, and
given to that infantile way of relieving the pressure of his
animal spirits which is, I believe, known as crowing. Not
believing in the classifications of temperament adopted by the
physiologists of a past age, the father forbears from describing
his child’s. For my lady readers I may add that he seems, at
least by his father’s account, to have been a good-sized, chubby
little fellow, fair and rosy in tint, with bright blue eyes, and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>limited crop of golden hair of an exceptionally rich, I don’t
know how many carat gold, hue. I shall speak of him under
his initial, C.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><i>First Year.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>The early pages of the record do not, one must confess, yield
any very striking observations. This is, no doubt, due to the
circumstance that the observer, not being a naturalist, was not
specially interested in the dim mindless life of the first weeks.
For the first few days Master C. appears to have been content
to vegetate like other babies of a similar age. Although a
bonny boy, he began life in the usual way—with a good cry;
though we now know, on scientific authority, that this, being a
purely reflex act, has not the deep significance which certain
pessimistic philosophers have attributed to it. Science would
probably explain in a similar way a number of odd facial movements
which this baby went through on the second day of his
earthly career, and which, the father characteristically remarks,
were highly suggestive of a cynical contempt for his new surroundings.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet, though content in this early stage to do little but
perform the vegetal functions of life, the infant comes endowed
with a nervous system and organs of sense, and these are very
soon brought into active play. According to this record, the
sense of touch is the first to manifest itself.<a id='r286' /><a href='#f286' class='c011'><sup>[286]</sup></a> Even when only
two hours old, at a period of life when there is certainly no
sound for the ear and possibly no light for the eye, C. immediately
clasped the parental finger which was brought into the
hollow of its tiny hand. The functional activity of touch was
observed still more plainly on the second day, when the child
was seen to carry out awkwardly enough what looked like
exploring movements of the hands over his mouth and face.
This early development in the child of the tactual sense agrees,
says the biographer, with what Aristotle long since taught respecting
the fundamental character of this sense, an idea to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>which the modern doctrine of evolution has given a new
significance.</p>

<p class='c001'>A distinct step is taken during the first four days towards
acquiring knowledge of things through a progressive use of the
eyes and hands. C.’s father noticed on the second day that a
good deal of ocular movement was forthcoming. Much of this
was quite irregular, each eye following its own path. Sometimes,
however, the eyes moved harmoniously or symmetrically now
to this side, now to that, and now and again seemed to converge
and fix themselves on some near object in front of them.
Sufficiently loud sounds increased these ocular movements.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the third day the father, when chuckling and calling to
the child at a short distance, fondly supposed that his offspring
showed appreciation of these attentions by regarding him with
a sweet expression and something like the play of a smile about
the lips and eyelids. But it is possible that this apparent
amiability was nothing but a purely animal satisfaction after a
good meal. As to <em>seeing</em> his father’s face at that early age,
there is room for serious doubt. Preyer found that long before
the close of the first day his child wore a different expression
when his face, turned towards the window, was suddenly deprived
of light by the intervention of the professor’s hand. If
the child is thus sensible to the pleasure of light it is, of course,
conceivable that C.’s eyes, happening in their aimless wanderings
to be brought together opposite the bright patch of the
father’s face, might maintain that attitude under the stimulus
of the pleasure. The father argues in favour of this view by
quoting the fact that C.’s sister was observed on the fourth day
to have her eyes arrested by a light or the father’s face if brought
pretty near the child; yet such blank staring at mere brightness
is, of course, a long way off from distinct vision of an object.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the fourth day, continues the sanguine father, the child
showed a distinct advance in the use of the hands. Having
clasped his sire’s finger he now moved it in what looked like
an abortive attempt to carry it to his mouth. There follow
some remarks on the impulse of infants to carry objects to
their mouths, in which again there seems an approach to
frivolity in the conjecture that the human animal previous to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>education is all-devouring. It is to be noted, however, that
these early movements are probably quite accidental. As we
shall see, it is some weeks before the child learns to carry
objects to his mouth. As to the connexion between this
movement and infantile greed our observer is not so poor a
psychologist as not to see that it may be due to the circumstance
that the lips and the tip of the tongue form one of
the most delicate parts of the <em>tactual</em> organ. It is not improbable
that in the evolution of man before the tactual sensibility
of the hand was developed these parts were chiefly
employed as a tactual apparatus in distinguishing and rejecting
what is hard, gritty and so forth in food. However this be, it
is probable that, as Stanley Hall has suggested, an infant may
get a kind of “æsthetic” pleasure by bringing objects into
contact with the lips and the gums.</p>

<p class='c001'>At this period, the diary remarks, the child was very cross
for some weeks and not a good subject for observation. This
new difficulty, added to that of overcoming natural scruples in
his guardians, appears to have baffled the observer for a time,
for the next observations recorded take up the thread of the
child’s history at the sixth week.</p>

<p class='c001'>About this date, the father notes, the power of directing
the eyes had greatly improved. The child could now converge
his eyes comfortably and without going through a number of
unpleasant squinting-like failures on a near object. The range
of sight had greatly increased, so that the boy’s universe, instead
of consisting merely of a tiny circle of near objects, as his
mother’s face held close to him, began to embrace distant
objects, as the clock, the window, and so forth. He was observed,
too, to carry out more precise movements of the head and eyes
in correspondence with the direction of sounds. This ability
to look towards the direction of a sound is an important attainment
as implying that the infant mind has now come to learn
that things may exist when not actually seen.</p>

<p class='c001'>This new command of the visual apparatus led to a marked
increase in observation. The boy may indeed be said to have
begun about this date something like a serious scrutiny of
objects. Like other children he was greatly attracted by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>brightly coloured objects. When just seven weeks old he
acquired a fondness for a cheap showy card with crudely
brilliant colouring and gilded border. When carried to the
place where it hung, above the glass over the fire-place,
he would look up to it and greet his first-love in the world of
art with a pretty smile. By the ninth or tenth week, the father
adds, he began to notice the pattern of the wall-paper and the
like.</p>

<p class='c001'>In these growing intervals of observation between the
discharge of the vegetal functions of feeding and sleeping, C.
was observed to examine not only any foreign object, such as
his mamma’s dress, which happened to be within sight, but
also the visible parts of his own organism. In the ninth week
of his existence he was first surprised in the act of surveying
his own hands. Why he should at this particular moment
have woke up to the existence of objects which had all along
lain within easy reach of the eye, is a question which has
evidently greatly exercised the father’s ingenuity. He hints,
but plainly in a half-hearted, sceptical way, at a possible dim
recognition by the little contemplator of the fact that these
objects belong to himself, forming, indeed, the outlying portion
of the Ego. He also asks (and here he seems to grow positively
frivolous) whether the child is taking after the somewhat
extravagant ways of his mother and beginning to dote on the
exquisite modelling of his tiny members.</p>

<p class='c001'>Psychologists are now agreed that our knowledge of the
properties of material objects is largely obtained by what they
call <em>active</em> touch, that is, by moving the hands over objects and
exploring the space around them. This is borne out by the
observations made on C. at this period of his existence. While
viewing things about him he actively manipulated them. The
organs of sight and touch worked indeed in the closest connexion.
Thus our little visitor was no mere passive spectator
of his new habitat; he actively took possession of his surroundings:
like the Roman general, he at once saw and conquered.
From the eighth to the tenth week his manual
performances greatly improved in quality. He was rapidly
learning to carry the organ of touch to the point of which his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>eye told him. An account of his progress in reaching objects
may however be postponed till we come to speak of the development
of his active powers.</p>

<p class='c001'>The growing habit of looking at, reaching out to, and
manually investigating objects, soon leads to the accumulation
of a store of materials for the construction of those complex
mental products which we call perceptions. And often-repeated
perceptions, when they become more clearly distinguished,
supply the basis of definite acts of recognition. The first
object that is clearly recognised through a special act of attention
is, of course, the face of the mother. In the case of C.,
the father’s face was apparently recognised about the eighth
week—at least, the youngster first greeted his parent with a
smile about this time—an event, I need hardly say, which is
recorded in very large and easily legible handwriting. The occurrence
gives rise to a number of odd reflexions in the parental
mind. The observer’s belief in the necessary co-operation of
sight and touch in the early knowledge of material objects leads
him to remark that C.’s manual experience of his face, and more
particularly of the bearded chin, has been extensive—an experience
which, he adds, has left its recollection in his own mind, too,
in the shape of a certain soreness. He then goes on to consider
the meaning of the smile. “I cannot,” he writes, “be of
any interest to him as a psychological student of his ways.
No, it must be in the light of a bearded plaything that he regards
my face.” Further observation bears out this argument by
going to show that the recognition was not individual but specific:
that it was simply a recognition of one of a class of bearded
people; for when a perfect stranger also endowed with the
entertaining appendage presented himself, C. wounded his
father’s heart by smiling at him in exactly the same way. Here
the diary goes off into some abstruse speculations about the first
mental images being what Mr. Galton calls generic images—speculations
into which we need not follow the writer. As we
shall see, the father takes up the subject of childish generalisation
more fully later on. The power of recognising objects
appeared to undergo rapid development towards the end of the
fourth month. The father remarks that the child would about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>this time recognise him in a somewhat dark room at a distance
of three or four yards.<a id='r287' /><a href='#f287' class='c011'><sup>[287]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The germ of true imagination, of the formation of what
Höffding calls a free or detached image of something not seen
at the moment, appeared about the same time. The moment
when the baby’s mind first passes on from the sight of his bottle
to a foregrasping or imagination of the blisses of prehension
and deglutition—a moment which appears to have been reached
by C. in his tenth week—marks an epoch in his existence.
He not only perceives what is actually present to his senses,
he pictures or represents what is absent. This is the moment
at which, to quote from the parent’s somewhat high-flown
observations on this event, “mind rises above the limitations
of the actual, and begins to shape for itself an ideal world of
possibilities”.</p>

<p class='c001'>This rise of the ideal to take the place of the real appeared
in other ways too. Thus when just eighteen weeks old the
child had been lying on his nurse’s lap and gazing on some
pictures on the wall of which he was getting fond. The nurse
happening to turn round suddenly put an end to his happiness.
Still the child was not to be done, but immediately began twisting
his head back in order to bring the pictures once more
into his field of view. Here we have an illustration of a
mental image appearing immediately after a perception, a rude
form of what psychologists are now getting to call a primary
memory-image.</p>

<p class='c001'>The expression of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>gourmet’s</i></span> delight at the sight of the
bottle (tenth week) involves a simple process of association.
Between the ages of five and six months the child’s progress
in building up associations was very marked. Thus he would
turn from a reflexion of the fire on the glass of a picture to the
fire itself, and a little later would look towards a particular
picture, Cherry Ripe, when the name was uttered. Further,
not only had he now learnt to connect the sight of the bottle
with the joys of a repast, but on seeing the basin in which his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>food is prepared he would glance towards the cupboard where
the bottle is kept.</p>

<p class='c001'>The diary contains but few observations on the growth of the
power of understanding things and reasoning about them during
the first year. One of the most interesting of these relates to the
understanding of reflexions, shadows, etc. We know that these
things played a considerable part in the development of the first
racial ideas of the supernatural, and we might expect to see them
producing an impression on the child’s mind. C. when he first
began to notice reflexions of the fire and other objects in a
mirror showed considerable marks of surprise. What quaint
fancies he may have had respecting this odd doubling of things
we cannot of course say. What is certain is that he distinctly
connected the reflexion with the original, as is shown by the
fact already mentioned, his turning from the first to the second.
By the end of the sixth month the marks of surprise had
visibly lessened, so that the child was apparently getting used
to the miracle, even though he could not as yet be said to
understand it. It is worth notice that though the experiment
of showing him his own reflexion was repeated again and again
he remained apparently quite indifferent to the image. Perhaps,
suggests the father, he did not as yet know himself as
visible object sufficiently to recognise nature’s portrait of him
in the glass.</p>

<p class='c001'>The above may perhaps serve as a sample of the observations
made on the intellectual development of this privileged
child during the first year of his earthly existence. I will now
pass on to quote a remark or two on his emotional development.
I may add that the record of this phase of the boy’s
early mental life is certainly the most curious part of the
document, containing many odd speculations on the course of
primitive human history.</p>

<p class='c001'>The earliest manifestations of the life of feeling are the
elemental forms of pain and pleasure, crying and incipient
laughing in the form of the smile.<a id='r288' /><a href='#f288' class='c011'><sup>[288]</sup></a> In C.’s case, as in others,
crying of the genuine miserable kind preceded smiling by a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>considerable interval. The child, remarks our observer, seems
to need to learn to smile, whereas his crying apparatus is in
good working order from the first.</p>

<p class='c001'>The growth of the smile is a curious chapter in child-psychology,
and has been carefully worked out by Preyer. The
observations on C. under this head are incomplete. The
father thought he detected an attempt at a smile on the third
day, when the child was lying replete with food, in answer to
certain chuckling sounds with which he sought to amuse him.
The movements constituting this quasi-smile are said to have
been the following: a drawing in of the under lip; a drawing
inwards and backwards of the corners of the mouth: increase
of oblique line from the corner of the mouth upwards; and a
furrowing or ridging of the eyelids. It is probable, however,
that this was not a true smile, <i>i.e.</i>, an expression of pleasure.
He remarks, moreover, that in the case of the child’s sister the
first approach to a smile was not observed before the tenth day,
this, too, by-the-bye, in that state of blissful complaisance which
follows a good meal. It may be added that in the case of the
brother, too, the smile seems to have grown noticeably bright
and significant about the same time (eighth to tenth week).
At this stage the boy expressed his pleasure at seeing his
father’s face not only by a “bright” smile, but by certain
cooing sounds. At the same date a playful touch on the
child’s cheek was sufficient to provoke a smile.<a id='r289' /><a href='#f289' class='c011'><sup>[289]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Very early in the infant’s course the germs of some of our
most characteristic human feelings begin to appear. One of
the earliest is anger, which though common to man and
many of the higher animals, takes on a peculiar form in
his case. Angry revolt against the order of things showed
itself early in C.’s case as in that of his sister, the occasion
being in each instance a momentary difficulty in seizing the
means of appeasing appetite. It is of course difficult to say
at what moment the mere vexation of disappointment passes
into true wrath, but in this boy’s case the father is compelled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>to admit that the ugly emotion displayed itself distinctly by the
third week.</p>

<p class='c001'>To detect the first clear signs of a <em>humane</em> feeling, of kindliness
and sympathy, is still more difficult. Reference has
already been made to the signs of pleasure, the smile and the
cooing sounds, which C. manifested at the sight of his father’s
face. About the same time, <i>viz.</i>, the ninth and tenth weeks,
he began to show himself particularly responsive to soothing
sounds. The impulse to imitate soft low sounds was of great
service in checking his misery. When utterly broken by grief
he would often pull himself together if appealed to by the
right soothing sound and join in a short plaintive duet. Such
responses like the early imitative smile may, it is true,
be nothing but a mechanical imitation, destitute of any emotive
significance. It is probable, however, that the first crude form
of fellow-feeling, of the impulse to accept and to give sympathy
in joy and grief, takes its rise in such simple imitative movements.
The first advance to signs of a truer fellow-feeling
was made when the child was six and a half months old. His
father pretended to cry. Thereupon C. bent his head down so
that his chin touched his breast and began to paw his father’s
face, very much after the manner of a dog in a fit of tenderness.
Oddly enough, adds the chronicler, there was no trace of sadness
in the child’s face. The experiment was repeated and always
with a like result. A smile on the termination of the crying
completed the curious little play. Who would venture to
interpret that falling of the head and that caressing movement
of the hand? The father saw here something of a divine tenderness;
and I am not disposed to question his interpretation.</p>

<p class='c001'>Emotion soon begins to manifest itself, too, in connexion
with the child’s peerings into his new world. As the little brain
grows stronger and the organs of sense come under better
management, the child spends more time in examining things,
and this examination is accompanied by a profound wonder.
C. would completely lose himself in marvelling at some new
mystery, as the face of a clock, to which he appeared
to talk as to something alive, or the play of the sunlight on
the wall of his room; and the closeness of his attention was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>indicated by the occurrence of a huge sigh when the strain was
over.</p>

<p class='c001'>The directions of this early childish attention are, as in the
example of the clock and the sunlight, towards what has some
attraction of brightness, or other stimulating quality. The fascination
of bright colour for C. has already been referred to.
Sounds, too, very soon began to capture his attention and hold it
spellbound. Thus it is recorded that in the tenth week the
sound produced by striking a wine-glass excited an agreeable
wonder. The sound of the piano, by-the-bye, made him cry
the first time he heard it, presumably because it was strange
and disconcertingly voluminous. But he soon got to like it,
and his mother remarked that when his father played the child
seemed to grow heavier in her lap, as if all his muscles were
relaxed in a delicious self-abandonment.<a id='r290' /><a href='#f290' class='c011'><sup>[290]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Certain things became favourite objects of this quasi-æsthetic
contemplation. When six weeks old the child got into the
way of taking special note of one or two rather showy coloured
pictures on the wall. In these it seemed to be partly the brightness
of colouring in the picture or the frame, partly the reflexions
of objects in the glass covering, which attracted him.
Other things which appeared to give him repeated and endless
enjoyment of a quiet sort were the play of sunlight and of
shadow on the walls of his room, the reflexion of the shooting
fire-flame sent back by the window-pane or the glass
covering of a picture, the swaying of trees, and the like. He
soon got to know the locality of some of his favourite works
of art, and to look out expectantly, when taken into the right
room, for his daily show.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet the new does not always awaken this pleasurable
admiration. The child’s organism soon begins to adapt
itself to what is customary, and sudden departures from the
usual order of things come as a shock, jar the nerves, and
produce the first crude form of fear. C.’s sensitiveness to the
disturbing effect of new and loud sounds has been referred to
in speaking of the first impression of the piano. A strong wind
making uproar in the trees quite upset him when he was about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>five months old, though he soon got over his dislike and would
laugh at the wind even when it blew cold. In like manner he
appeared to be much put out by the voices of strangers,
especially when these were loud. A similar effect of shock
showed itself when something in the familiar scene was suddenly
transmuted. For example, when just twelve weeks old, he was
quite upset by his mother donning a red jacket in place of the
usual flower-spotted dress. He was just proceeding to take his
breakfast when he noticed the change, at the discovery of which
all thoughts of feasting deserted him, his lips quivered, and he
only became reassured of his whereabouts after taking a good
look at his mother’s face.</p>

<p class='c001'>This clinging to the familiar and alarm at a sudden intrusion
of the new into his little world showed themselves in a curious
way in his attitude towards strangers. When ten weeks old
he would still greet new faces with a gracious smile. But this
amiable disposition soon underwent a change. When he began
to discriminate people one from another and to single out
particular faces, those of the mother, father, sister, etc., as
familiar, he took up what looked like a less hospitable attitude
towards strangers. By the fifteenth week he no longer greeted
their advent with his welcoming smile. A month later the
diary chronicles a new development of timidity. He now turned
away from a stranger with all the signs of shrinking.<a id='r291' /><a href='#f291' class='c011'><sup>[291]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>That this repugnance to the new depends on a kind of
shock-like effect on the nervous system seems to be borne out
by the fact that the same object would produce now joyous
admiration, now something indistinguishable from fear, according
to the boy’s varying condition of health and spirits.</p>

<p class='c001'>Changes of sentiment analogous to those which marked his
behaviour towards strangers occurred in his treatment of inanimate
objects. For instance, a not very alarming-looking
doll belonging to his sister, after having been a pleasant object
of regard, suddenly acquired for him, when he was nearly five
months old, a repulsive aspect. Instead of talking to it and
making a sort of amiable deity of it as heretofore, he now
shrieked when it was brought near. There seems to have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>nothing in his individual experience which could account for
this sudden accession of fear.</p>

<p class='c001'>These observations led C.’s father to some characteristic
speculations as to the inheritance of certain feelings. Thus
he hints that the eerie sort of interest taken by his child in the
reflexions of things in the glass may be a survival of the
primitive feeling of awe for the ghosts of things which certain
anthropologists tell us was first developed in connexion with
the phenomena of reflected images and shadows. He goes on
to ask whether the fear called forth by the doll and the face
of strangers at a certain stage of the child’s development is
not clearly due to an instinct now fixed in the race by the
countless experiences of peril in its early, pre-social, and
Ishmaelitic condition. But here, too, perhaps, his speculations
appear, in the light of what has been said above, a little wild.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among other feelings displayed by the child was that of
amusement at what is grotesque and comical. When between
four and five months old he was accustomed to watch the antics
of his sister, an elfish being given to flying about the room,
screaming, and other disorderly proceedings, with all the signs
of a sense of the comicality of the spectacle. So far as the
father could judge, this sister served as a kind of jester to the
baby monarch. He would take just that distant, good-natured
interest in her foolings that Shakespeare’s sovereigns took in
the eccentric unpredictable ways of their jesters. The sense
of the droll became still more distinctly marked at six months.
About this date the child delighted in pulling his sister’s
hair, and her shrieks would send him into a fit of laughter.
Among other provocatives of laughter at this time were sudden
movements of one’s head, a rapid succession of sharp staccato
sounds from one’s vocal organ (when these were not disconcerting
by their violence), and of course sudden reappearances of
one’s head after hiding in the game of bo-peep.<a id='r292' /><a href='#f292' class='c011'><sup>[292]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It is hardly necessary to follow the diary into its record
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>of the first stirrings of what psychologists used to call the
Will (with capital <i>W</i> of course). If a baby in the first months
can be said to have a will in any sense it must be that unconscious
metaphysical “will to live” about which we have
recently heard so much. On the other hand it is certainly
true that the child manifests in the first weeks certain active
impulses, the working out of which leads in about four months
to the acquisition of the power of carrying out movements
for a purpose. Reference has already been made to this
progress in motor activity when speaking of the senses. It
may suffice to add one or two further observations.</p>

<p class='c001'>The father remarks that about the end of the ninth week
there was a vigorous use of the muscles of the arms and hands
in aimless movement. This superabundance of muscular
activity is important, as giving children the chance of finding
out the results of their movements. C. was just ten and a
half weeks old when he first showed himself capable lying
on his back of turning his head to the side, and even of half
turning his body also, in order to have a good view of his
father moving away to a distant part of the room.</p>

<p class='c001'>About the same date, too, purposive movements began to
be clearly differentiated from expressive movements; such, for
example, as the quick energetic movement of the limbs when
excited by pleasure. For instance, on the seventy-second day
the father was surprised and delighted to see the boy add to
the usual signs of joy at his approach the movement of leaning
forward and holding out the arms as if to try to get near.
Was this, he asks, the sudden emergence of an unlearnt instinct,
or was it an imitation in baby fashion of his elders’ behaviour
when they took possession of him?</p>

<p class='c001'>The gradual growth of a voluntary movement into a
perfect artistic action nicely adjusted to some desired end was
strikingly illustrated in the boy’s mastery of the grasping
movement, the movement of stretching out the hand to seize
an object seen. On the seventy-sixth day, the father writes,
he had carefully watched to see whether the child could
voluntarily direct his hand to an object. He had tried him by
holding before him attractive objects, as a bit of coloured rag
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>or his hand, which he would regard very attentively. For
the last week or ten days he had been very observant of
objects, including his own hands.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among the objects that attracted him was his mamma’s
dress, which had a dark ground with a small white flower
pattern. On this memorable day his hand accidentally came
in contact with one of the folds of her dress lying over the
breast. Immediately, it seemed to strike him for the first time
that he could <em>reach</em> an object, and for a dozen times or more he
repeated the movement of stretching out his hand, clutching the
fold and giving it a good pull, very much to his own satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c001'>A hasty reasoner might easily suppose that the child had
now learnt to reach out to an object when only seen. But the
sequel showed that this was not the case. Four weeks later
the diary observes that the child as yet made no attempt to
grasp an object offered to him (although there were manifest
attempts to uncover the mother’s breast). The clutching at the
dress was thus a blind movement due to the stimulus of
pleasurable elation. Yet it was doubtless a step in the process
of learning to grasp.</p>

<p class='c001'>The next advance registered occurred when the boy was a
little over four months old. He would now bring his two
hands together just above the level of his eyes and then
gaze on them attentively, striking out one arm straight in front
of him, and upwards almost vertically, as if he were trying some
new gymnastic exercises, while he accompanied each movement
with his eye, and showed the deepest interest in what he
was doing. By such exercises, we may suppose, he was
exploring space with hand and eye conjointly and noting the
correspondences between looking in a given direction and
bringing his hand into the line of sight.</p>

<p class='c001'>The next noticeable advance occurred at the end of the
nineteenth week. The boy’s father held a biscuit (the value
of which was already known) just below his face and well
within his reach. There was a very earnest look and then a
series of rapid jerky movements of the hands. These were
uncertain at first, but on repetition of the experiment soon
grew more precise. At first the biscuit was dropped (the child
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>had not yet learnt to handle things). But after repeated trials
he managed to hold on to the treasure and bear it triumphantly
to his mouth. The discovery of the new delight of thus feeding
himself led to more violent efforts to seize the biscuit
when presented again. Indeed, the youngster’s impatience
led him to reach forward with the upper part of his body so
as to seize the biscuit with his mouth. It may be added here
as throwing light on the carrying of the biscuit to the mouth
that the child had before this acquired considerable facility in
raising his hand to his mouth and to the region of his head
generally. Thus he had been noticed to scratch his head with
a comical look of sage reflexion when he was fifteen weeks old.</p>

<p class='c001'>The consummation of the act of seizing an object involving
a perception of distance was observed when he was just six
months old. The father writes: “I held an object in front
of him two or three inches beyond his reach. The astute
little fellow made no movement. I then gradually brought
it closer, and when it came within his reach he held out his
hand and grasped it. I repeated the experiment with slight
variations, and satisfied myself that he could now distinguish
with some degree of precision the near and the far, the attainable
and the unattainable, that his eyes could now inform him
by what Bishop Berkeley called visual language of the exact
limit, the ‘Ultima Thule’ of his tangible world.” It is natural,
no doubt, that the father should go off into another high flight
here. But being a psychologist he might have moderated his
parental elation by reflecting that his wonderful boy had after
all taken six months to learn what a chick seems to know as
soon as it leaves the shell. It is doubtful, indeed, whether
Master C.’s hand could as yet aim with the precision of the
beak of the newly hatched chick. If he had only chanced on
a later decade he might have known that five months is the
time given by a recent authority (Raehlmann) as the period
commonly taken in learning the grasping movements, and so
had his pride in his boy’s achievement wholesomely tempered.<a id='r293' /><a href='#f293' class='c011'><sup>[293]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>These early movements are acquired under the stimulus of
certain impulses which constitute the instinctive basis of
volition. Thus it is obvious that the movement of carrying
to the mouth as also that of reaching and grasping was inspired
by the nutritive or feeding instinct, that deep-seated impulse
which is common to man and the whole animal kingdom, and
is the secret spring of so much of his proud achievement. The
impulse to seize and appropriate may perhaps be regarded
as an instinct which has become detached from its parental
stock, the nutritive impulse. Our observer remarks, with a touch
of cynicism, that the predominance of the grasping propensities
of the race was illustrated by the fact that his boy only manifested
the impulse to relinquish his hold on an object some time after
he had displayed in its perfection the impulse to seize or grasp
an object. Thus it was some months later that he was first
observed deliberately to cast aside, as if tired of it, a thing
with which he had been playing.</p>

<p class='c001'>One of the deepest and most far-reaching instincts is to get
rid of pain and to prolong pleasure. In C.’s case the working of
the first was illustrated in a large number of movements, such as
twisting the body round, scratching the head, and so forth. An
illustration of the impulse to renew an agreeable effect occurred
in the early part of the eighth month. The child was sitting
on his mother’s lap close to the table playing with a spoon.
He accidentally dropped it and was impressed with the effect
of sound. He immediately repeated the action, now, no doubt,
with the purpose of gaining the agreeable shock for his ear.
After this when the spoon was put into his hand he deliberately
dropped it. Not only so, like a true artist, he went on improving
on the first effect, raising the spoon higher and higher so
as to get more sound, and at length using force in dashing or
banging it down.</p>

<p class='c001'>Children, as everybody knows, are wont to render their
elders that highest form of flattery, imitation. Our chronicle
is unfortunately rather meagre in observations on the first
imitative movements. There is no evidence that the writer
went to work in Preyer’s careful way to test this capability.
He thinks he saw distinct traces of imitation (of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>the pointing movement) at the end of the fifteenth week,
though he admits that a deliberate attempt to copy a
movement was only placed beyond doubt some time later.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is, I regret to say, a terrible gap in the chronicle between
the ninth and the sixteenth month. This is particularly
unfortunate because this is just the period when the child is
making a beginning at some of the most difficult of accomplishments,
<i>e.g.</i>, mastering the speech of his ancestors. To make
up for this loss, the record becomes fuller and decidedly more
interesting as we enter upon the second year. To this next
stage of the history we may now pass.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><i>Second Year.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>The observations from the date of the resumption of the
diary, at the age of sixteen months, begin to have more of
human interest about them. It is not till this year has advanced
that the child makes headway in handling the knotty
intricacies of an elaborate language like ours, and it is through
the medium of this mastered speech that he is best able to
disclose himself to the observer. The observations on C.’s
progress during the second year relate largely to language and
intelligence as expressing itself in language. We may, accordingly,
begin this section by giving a brief sketch of the child’s
linguistic progress.<a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c011'><sup>[294]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>During the first six months nothing was observable in the
way of vocal sounds but the ordinary baby-singing utterances
of the ‘la-la’ category. In this tentative vocalisation vowel
sounds, of course, preponderated. There was quite a gamut of
quaint vowel sounds, ranging from the broad <em>a</em> to the cockney
<em>ow</em>, that is, <em>a-oo</em>. These sounds were purely emotional signs.
Thus a prolonged <em>ā</em> sound indicated surprise with a dash of displeasure
when the child suddenly encountered an obstacle to his
movements, as on catching his dress or striking his head gently.
Again, a kind of <em>ō</em> or <em>oo</em> sound, formed by sucking in the breath,
appeared to indicate that the small person was pleased with
some new object of contemplation, as a freshly discovered
picture.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>A sudden enlargement of the range of articulatory excursion
was noticeable on the completion of the twenty-seventh week,
when C. astonished his parents by breaking out into a series
of ‘da-da’s’ and ‘ba-ba’s’ or ‘pa-pa’s’. These reduplications
were quite in keeping with his earlier sounds, <i>e.g.</i>, <em>a-oo</em>, <em>a-oo</em>.
He soon followed up this brilliant success by other experiments,
as in the production of the sounds <em>ou-a</em> and <em>ditta</em>, also <em>ung</em>
and <em>ang</em>.<a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c011'><sup>[295]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Coming now to the commencement of the true linguistic
period, that is to say, when C. had attained the age of sixteen
months, we find him by no means precocious in the matter
of speech. He reproduced very few of the many names the
meaning of which he perfectly understood. As to other verbal
signs he seems to have acted on the principle of biological
economy, saving himself the articulatory effort. Thus although
he used sounds for expressing assent, <i>viz.</i>, “ey,” with
falling inflection, he contented himself in the case of negation
with the old declining or refusing gesture, <i>viz.</i>, shaking the
head. The movement of nodding seems to have been first
used as an affirmative sign at the age of seventeen months
when he was asked whether his food was hot.<a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c011'><sup>[296]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>C. illustrated the common childish impulse to mimic natural
sounds. Thus when sixteen months old he spontaneously
imitated in a rough fashion the puffing sound produced by his
father when indulging in the solace of tobacco; and he uttered
a similar explosive sound when hearing the wind. Yet this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>child does not seem to have been a particularly good illustration
of the onomatopoetic impulse.</p>

<p class='c001'>While the imitative impulse thus aids in the growth of an
independent baby vocabulary, it contributes, as we have seen,
to the adoption of the language of the community. At first,
however, the little learner will not repeat a sound merely in
response to another’s lead. Many a mother is doubtless able to
recall the chagrin which she experienced when on trying to
trot out her baby’s linguistic powers by giving the lead, <i>e.g.</i>,
“Say ta-ta to the lady!” the little autocrat obdurately refused
to comply with the parental injunction. It is only when what
the child himself considers to be the appropriate circumstances
recur, and, what is more, when the corresponding feeling is
excited in his breast, that he utters the sound. Thus C.’s
father observes that though the child will not say “ta-ta”
when told to do so, he will say it readily enough when he sees
him, hat in hand, moving towards the door. In like manner
the father remarks: “He will say, ‘Ta’ (‘thank you’), on
receiving something, yet not do so in mere response to me
when I say it”. Herein, it would seem, the vocal imitation of
children is less mechanical and more intelligent than that of
animals, as the parrot.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was not until he was well on in his second year that C.
condescended to let his young speech-organ be played on by
another’s will. By this time, it may be conjectured, associations
between sounds and vocal actions had become firm enough
to allow of such imitation without a consciousness of exertion
or strain. Having no special reason to refuse he very sensibly
fell in with others’ suggestions. It is not at all improbable, too,
that at this stage of development the little vocalist found a
pleasure in trying his instrument and producing new effects.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of course these first tentatives in verbal imitation were far
from perfect. At first there was hardly more than a reproduction
of the rhythm and the rise and fall of voice, as in
rendering ‘All gone,’ the sign of disappearance, by <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, with
rise and fall of voice. Like other little people, C. displayed a
lordly disposition to save himself trouble and to expect infinite
pains from others in the way of comprehension. He was in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>the habit of reducing difficult words to fragments, the comprehension
of which by the most loyal of attendants was a
matter of considerable difficulty. In thus chopping off splinters
of words he showed the greatest caprice. In many cases he
selected the initial sounds, <i>e.g.</i>, “bŏ” for ball, “nō” for nose,
“pē” for please. In other cases he preferred the ending, <i>e.g.</i>,
“ĕk” for cake, “bĕ” for Elizabeth. It looked as if certain
sounds and combinations, <i>e.g.</i>, <em>l</em>, <em>s</em>, <em>fl</em>, <em>sh</em>, etc., lay altogether
beyond his gamut. And others seemed to be specially difficult,
and so were avoided as much as possible.<a id='r297' /><a href='#f297' class='c011'><sup>[297]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>While C.’s parents could not help resenting at times an
economising of speech-power which imposed so heavy a
burden on themselves, they were often amused at the way in
which the astute little fellow managed after softening down all
the asperities of a name to retain a certain rough semblance
of the original. Thus, for instance, sugar became “ooga,”
biscuit “bĭk,” bread and butter “bup,” fish “gish” (with
soft <em>g</em>), and bacon-fat, that is bread dipped in the same, “ak”.
In some cases it might have puzzled his father to say whether
the sound was a reproduction or an independent creation.
This remark applies with particular force to the name he gave
himself. His real name as commonly used was, I may say,
Clifford. Instead of this he employed as the name for himself
“Ingi” or “Ningi” (with hard <em>g</em>). He stuck to his own
invention in spite of many efforts to lead him to adopt the
name chosen for him by his parents. And perhaps the
sovereignty of the baby was never more clearly illustrated than
in the fact that in time he constrained his parents and his sister
to adopt his self-chosen prænomen. Possibly his real name was
to his ear a hopelessly difficult mass of sound, and “Ningi”
seemed to him a fair equivalent within the limits of practicable
linguistics for so uncouth a combination.<a id='r298' /><a href='#f298' class='c011'><sup>[298]</sup></a> These changes are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>interesting as illustrating how the child attends to the general
form of the word-sound rather than to its constituent elements.<a id='r299' /><a href='#f299' class='c011'><sup>[299]</sup></a>
The same thing is seen in the modified form of “Ningi,” which
he adopted at the beginning of the third year, <i>viz.</i>, “Kikkie,”
where, too, the special impressiveness of the initial sound is
illustrated.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is now time to pass to the most important phase of baby-speech
from a scientific point of view, namely, the first use of
sounds as general signs, or as registering the results of a
generalising process, as when the child begins to speak of man
or boy.</p>

<p class='c001'>It must be confessed that our diary does not give us much
that is startling in the way of original generalisation. So far
as we can judge, C. was a steady-going baby, not given to
wanton caprices. Yet though not a genius he had his moments
of invention. One of the earliest illustrations of a free working
of the generalising impulse was the extension of the
sound “ŏt” (hot). At first he employed this sign in the conventional
manner to indicate that his milk or other viand was
disagreeably warm. When, however, he was seventeen and a
half months old he struck out an original extension of meaning.
He happened to have placed before him cold milk. On tasting
this he at once exclaimed, “Ot!” It looks as though the
sound now meant something unpleasant to taste, though, as
we shall see presently, the boy had another sound (“kaka”) for
expressing this idea.<a id='r300' /><a href='#f300' class='c011'><sup>[300]</sup></a> But “ot” was being extended in another
way by a process of association. This was illustrated a
month later, when the boy pointed to an engraving of Guido’s
<cite>Aurora</cite>, and exclaimed, “Ot!” His dull parents could not at
first comprehend this bold metaphoric use of language, until they
bethought them that the clouds on which the aeronauts are
sailing are a good deal like a volume of ascending steam.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>The sounds “kĕ,” “kă,” and “kăkă” were employed by C.
from about the same age (seventeen and a half months) to
express what is actually known or simply suspected to be disagreeable
to taste or smell, such as a pipe held near him, a
glass of beer, a vinegar bottle, and so forth. He had smelt the
beer, and learnt its disagreeable odour, and in pronouncing the
untried vinegar “kăkă” he was really carrying out a form of
reasoning of a simple kind. This sound came to represent a
much higher effort of abstraction some weeks later, when it
was applied to things so unlike in themselves as milk spilt on
the cloth, crumbs on the floor, soiled hands, etc. The idea here
seized was plainly that of something soiled or dirty. But this
half-æsthetic, half-ethical idea was reached largely by the
help of others, more particularly perhaps his sister, who, as
elder sisters are wont to do, supplemented the parental
discipline by a vigorous inculcation of the well-recognised
proprieties.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another extension of the range of application of names used
by others occurred about the same time (end of twentieth month).
He employed the sound ‘ga’ (glass) so as to include a plated
drinking cup, which of course others always called ‘cup’.
This was curious as showing at this stage the superior interest
of use (that of drinking utensil) to that of form and colour.</p>

<p class='c001'>The generalisations just touched on have to do with those
qualities and relations of things which strongly impress the
baby mind, because they bear on the satisfaction of his wants
and his feelings of pleasure and pain. In order to watch the
calm movements of the intellect, when no longer urged by
appetite and sense, we must turn to the child’s first detection
of similarities in the objective attributes of things, as their
shape, size, colour, and so forth. Here the first generalisations
respecting the forms of bodies are a matter of peculiar interest
to the scientific observer. The young thinker, with whom we
are now specially concerned, achieved his first success in
geometric abstraction, or the consideration of pure form, when
just seventeen months old. He had learnt the name of his
india-rubber ball. Having securely grasped this, he went on
calling oranges “bŏ”. This left the father in some doubt whether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>the child was attending exclusively to form, as a geometrician
should, for he was wont to make a toy of an orange, as when
rolling it on the floor. This uncertainty was, however, soon
removed. One day C. was sitting at table beside his sire,
while the latter was pouring out a glass of beer. Instantly the
ready namer of things pointed to the bubbles on the surface,
and exclaimed, “Bŏ!” This was repeated on many subsequent
occasions. As the child made no attempt to handle the
bubbles, it was evident that he did not view them as possible
playthings. As he got lost in contemplation, muttering, “Bŏ!
bŏ!” his father tells us that he had the satisfaction of feeling
sure that the young mind was already learning to turn away
from the coarseness of matter, and fix itself on the refined
attribute of form.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although this was the most striking instance of pure or
abstract consideration of form, attention to the shape of things
was proved by many of the simple ideas reached at this stage.
It is obvious, indeed, that a ready recognition of any member
of a species of animals, as dog, in spite of considerable
variations in size and colour, implies a power of singling out
for special attention what we call relations of form. And this
conclusion is borne out by the fact that by the end of the
eighteenth month C. was quite an adept in recognising
uncoloured drawings of animal and other familiar forms.</p>

<p class='c001'>Colour is of course in itself of much more interest to a
child than form, since it gives a keen sensuous enjoyment.
Our diary furnishes a curious illustration of a propensity
to classify things according to their colour. In his nineteenth
month C. was observed to designate by the sound
“appoo” (apple) a patch of reddish colour on the mantelpiece,
which bore in its form no discoverable resemblance
to an apple. At the same time, the effect of growing experience
and of a deeper scrutiny of things in bringing out
the superior significance of form is seen in the fact that this
same word “appoo” came subsequently to be habitually
applied to things of unlike colours, namely, apples, oranges,
lemons, etc. It may be added that the history of this word
“appoo” illustrates a process analogous to what Archbishop
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>Trench (if I remember rightly) has called the degradation of
words. When C. first used this name it designated objects
simply as visible and tangible ones; he knew nothing of
their taste. After he was permitted to try their flavours, the
less worthy sensations now added naturally contributed a
prominent ingredient to the meaning of the word. Thus,
he began to use “appoo” for all edible fruits, including such
shapeless masses as stewed apples.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is not to be expected that children in their first attempts
at scrutinising objects should be able to take in completely
a complex form, as that of an animal, with all its parts
and their relations one to another. C. gave ample proof
of the fact that the first generalisations respecting form are apt
to be rough and ready, grounded simply on a perception of one
or two salient points. Thus, his first use of “bow-wow”
showed that the name meant for him simply a four-legged
creature. About the fifteenth month this word was thrown
about in the most reckless way. Later on, when the canine
form began to be disengaged in his mind from those of other
quadrupeds, the pointed nose of the animal seems to have become
a prominent feature in the meaning of the word. Thus,
in his eighteenth month, C. took to applying the name ‘bow-wow’
to objects, such as fragments of bread or biscuit, as well
as drawings, having something of a triangular form with a sharp
angle at the apex. It is probable that if our little thinker had
been able at this stage to define his terms, he would have said
that a “bow-wow” was a four-legged thing with a pointed
nose.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here, however, it is only fair to C. to mention that his
mind had at this time become prepossessed with the image of
“bow-wow”. Not long before the date referred to he had been
frightened by a small dog, which had crept unobserved into the
room behind a lady visitor, lain quiet for some time under the
table, and then, forgetting good manners, suddenly darted out
and barked. There were many facts which supported the
belief that the child’s mind was at this period haunted by
images of dogs which approximated in their vividness to
hallucinations; and this persistence of the canine image in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>the child’s brain naturally disposed him to see the “bow-bow”
form in the most unpromising objects.</p>

<p class='c001'>The use of the word “gee-gee,” which towards the end of
the second year competed with “bow-wow” for the first place
in C.’s vocabulary, illustrates the same fact. A horse
was first of all distinguished from other quadrupeds by the
length of his neck. Thus, when twenty months old, C. in a
slovenly way, no doubt, applied the name “gee-gee” to the
drawing of an ostrich, and also to a bronze figure representing
a stork-like bird. This is particularly curious, as showing how
a comparatively unimportant detail of form, as length of neck,
overshadowed in his mind at this time what we should consider
the much more important feature, the possession of four legs.
The following are selected from among many other illustrations
of the imperfect observation of complex forms. When twenty-one
and a half months old he took to calling all triangular
objects, including drawings, “ship”. The feature of the ship—as
seen in real life and in his picture-books—which had
fixed itself in his mind was the triangular sail.<a id='r301' /><a href='#f301' class='c011'><sup>[301]</sup></a> A similar
propensity to select one characteristic feature was illustrated in
another quaint observation of the diary. When twenty-three
months old C.’s mother showed him a number of drawings
of patterns of dresses, some surmounted by faces, some not.
He pointed to one of the latter and said: “No nose!” From
this, writes the father, lapsing again into his frivolous vein, it
would seem that at this early age he had acquired a dim presentiment
of the supreme dignity of the nasal organ among the
features of the human countenance.</p>

<p class='c001'>Progress in the accurate use of words was curiously
illustrated in C.’s way of looking at and talking about his
fellow-creatures. Oddly enough he began apparently by confusing
his two parents, extending the name “ma” to his
father till such time as he learnt “papa”. Then he proceeded
after the manner of other children to embrace within
the term “papa” all male adults, whether known to
him or not. Thus he applied the name to photographs of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>distinguished savants, artists, and poets, which he found in
his father’s album. When just eighteen months old he was
observed to introduce the word ‘man’. For instance, he took
to calling an etching of a recent British philosopher, and a
terra-cotta cast of an ancient Roman one, “man,” as well as
“papa”. Oddly enough, however, members of the other sex
were still called exclusively by the name “mamma,” though
the words “woman” and “lady” were certainly used at least as
frequently as “man” in his hearing. This earlier discrimination
of individual men than of individual women leads the
father into some jocose observations about the more strongly
marked individuality of men than of women, observations which
would do very well in the mouth of a misogynist of the old
school, but are altogether out of date in this advanced age.</p>

<p class='c001'>By the twentieth month the extension of the name “papa”
to other men was discontinued. His father tried him at this
date with a photographic album. “Man” was now instantly
applied to all male adults, except old ones with a grey beard.
To these he invariably applied the name of an old gentleman,
a friend of his. A woman was still called “mamma,” though
the term “lady” (“’ady”) was clearly beginning to displace it;
and no distinction was drawn between women of different
ages. Finally, children were distinguished as boys or girls,
apparently according as they were or were not dressed in
petticoats.</p>

<p class='c001'>The reservation of the names “papa” and “mamma” for
his parents naturally gave pleasure to these worthy persons.
It was something, they said, to feel sure at length that they
were individualised in the consciousness of their much-cared-for
offspring. This restricted use of the terms may be supposed
to have involved a dim apprehension of a special relation of
things to the child. “Papa” now carried with it the idea of the
man who stands in a particular connexion with C. or “Ningi”;
or, to express it otherwise, “man” began to signify those
papas who have nothing specially to do with this important
personage. This antecedent conjecture is borne out by the
fact that the act of distinguishing between his father and other
men followed rapidly, certainly within two or three weeks, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>first use of his own name “Ningi”. In other words, as soon
as his attention began to direct itself to himself, as the centre
of his little world-circle, he naturally went on to distinguish
between those persons and things that had some special
connexion with this centre and those that had not.</p>

<p class='c001'>The consciousness of self was noticed to grow much more
distinct in the second half of this year. As might be expected
the first idea of ‘self’ was largely a mental picture of the
body. Thus the father tells us that when eighteen months
old the child would instantly point to himself when he heard
his name. If his father touched his face asking who that was,
he replied, ‘Ningi’. Here the corporeal reference is manifest.
When just over nineteen months, however, he showed that the
idea was becoming fuller and richer with the germ of what we
mean by the word personality. Thus when asked to give up
something he liked, as the remnant of a biscuit, he would say
emphatically, ‘No, no! Ningi!’ Similarly, when he saw his
sister wipe her hands, he would say ‘Ningi!’ and proceed to
imitate the action. By the end of the twenty-first month the
child began to substitute ‘me’ for ‘Ningi’.</p>

<p class='c001'>As we saw above, the child and the poet have this in common,
that they view things directly as they are, free from the superficial
and arbitrary associations, the conventional trappings, by
the additions of which we prosaic people are wont to separate
them into compartments with absolutely impenetrable walls.
Hence the freshness, the charming originality of their utterances.</p>

<p class='c001'>For example, C., when eighteen months old, was watching
his sister as she dipped her crust into her tea. He was
evidently surprised by the rare sight, and after looking a
moment or two, exclaimed, “Ba!” (bath), laughing with
delight, and trying, as was his wont when deeply interested in
a spectacle, to push his mother’s face round so that she too
might admire it. The boy delighted in such a figurative use of
words, now employing them as genuine similes, as when he
said of a dog panting after a run, “Dat bow-wow like puff-puff,”
and of the first real ship which he saw sailing with a rocking
movement, “Dat ship go marjory-daw” (<i>i.e.</i>, like marjory-daw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>in the nursery rhyme). Like many a poet he had his recurring
or standing metaphors. Thus, as we have seen, “ship” was
the figurative expression for all objects having a pyramidal
form. A pretty example of his love of metaphor was his habit
of calling the needle in a small compass of his father’s “bir”
(bird). It needs a baby mind to detect here the faint resemblance
to the slight fragile form and the fluttering movement
of a bird poised on its wings.</p>

<p class='c001'>C. illustrates the anthropocentric impulse to look at natural
objects as though they specially aimed at furthering or hindering
our well-being. Thus he would show all the signs of kingly
displeasure when his serenity of mind was disturbed by noises.
When he was taken to the sea-side (about twenty-four months
old) he greatly disappointed his parent, expectant of childish
wonder in his eyes, by merely muttering, “Water make
noise”.<a id='r302' /><a href='#f302' class='c011'><sup>[302]</sup></a> Again, he happened one day in the last week of
this year to be in the garden with his father while it was
thundering. On hearing the sound he said with an evident
tone of annoyance, “Tonna mâ Ningi noi,” <i>i.e.</i>, thunder
makes noise for C., and he instantly added “Notty tonna!”
(naughty thunder). Here, remarks the father, he was evidently
falling into that habit of mind against which philosophers have
often warned us, making man the measure of the universe.</p>

<p class='c001'>The last quarter of this year was marked in C.’s case by a
great enlargement of linguistic power. A marked advance was
noticeable in the mastering of the mechanical difficulties of
articulation. Thus he would surprise his father by suddenly
bringing out new and difficult combinations of sound, as
‘flower,’ ‘water’ and ‘fetch’. Up to about the twenty-first
month C.’s vocabulary had consisted almost entirely of what
we should call substantives, such as, ‘papa,’ ‘man,’ which were
used to express the arrival on the scene and the recognition of
familiar objects. A few adjectives, as “ŏt” (hot), “co” (cold),
“ni-ni” (nice), and “goo” (good), were frequently used, and
were apparently beginning to have a proper attributive function
assigned them. But these referred rather to the effect of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>things on the child’s feeling than to their inherent qualities.
His father failed before this date to convey to him the meaning
of “black” as applied to a dog. It is noteworthy that the
child made considerable advance in the use of “me” and
“my” before he was capable of qualifying objects by appending
adjectives to them. The first use of an adjective for indicating
some objective quality in a thing occurred at the end
of the twenty-first month, when he exclaimed on seeing a
rook fly over his head, “Big bir!”</p>

<p class='c001'>At about the same date other classes of words came to be
recognised and used as such, giving to the child’s language
something of texture. Thus relations of place began to be set
forth, as in using simple words like ‘up,’ ‘down,’ ‘on’. In
some cases the designation of these relations was effected by
original artifices which often puzzled the father. For instance
the sound ‘da’ (or ‘dow’) was used from about the seventeenth
month for the departure of a person, the falling of a toy on the
ground, the completion of a meal. It seemed to be a general
sign for ‘over’ or ‘gone’.<a id='r303' /><a href='#f303' class='c011'><sup>[303]</sup></a> It is doubtful whether this implied
a clear consciousness of a relation of place. Sometimes the
attempt to express such a relation in the absence of the needed
words would lead to a picturesque kind of circumlocution. Thus
when about twenty-one months old C. saw his father walking
in the garden when he and his sister were seated at the
luncheon table. He shouted out, ‘Papa ’at off!’ thus expressing
the desirability of his father’s entering and taking part
in the family meal.</p>

<p class='c001'>Similar make-shifts would be resorted to in designating other
and more subtle relations. Sometimes, indeed, the child would
expect his hearers to supply the sign of relation, as when after
having smelt the pepper box he put it away with an emphatic
‘Papa!’ which seemed to the somewhat biassed observer an
admirably concise way of expressing the judgment that the
pepper might suit his father, but it certainly did not suit him.
A month later (<i>æt.</i> twenty-two months) he condescended to be
more explicit. Having been told by his father that the cheese
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>was bad for Ningi, he indulged a growing taste for antithesis
by adding, ‘Good, papa!’</p>

<p class='c001'>His ideas of time-relations were at this date of the haziest.
He seems to have got a dim inkling of the meaning of ‘by-and-by’.
His father had managed to stop his crying for a thing
by promising it ‘by-and-by’. After this when crying he would
suddenly pull up, and with a heroic effort to catch his breath
would exclaim, ‘By-’n’-by!’ “What (asks the father) was the
equivalent of this new symbol in the child’s consciousness?
Was he already beginning to seize the big boundless future
set over against the fleeting point of the present moment and
holding in its ample bosom consolatory promises for myriads
of these unhappy presents?” and so forth; but here he seems
to grow even less severely scientific than usual. It may be added
that about the same time (twenty-one months) the child began
to use the word ‘now’. Thus after drinking his milk he would
point to a little remainder at the bottom of his cup and say,
‘Milk dare now,’ that is presumably ‘there is still milk there’.</p>

<p class='c001'>His ideas of number at this time were equally rudimentary.
Oddly enough it was just as he was attaining to plurality of
years that he began to distinguish with the old Greeks the one
from the many. One was correctly called ‘one’. Any number
larger than one, on the other hand, was sometimes styled ‘two,’<a id='r304' /><a href='#f304' class='c011'><sup>[304]</sup></a>
sometimes ‘three,’ and sometimes ‘two, three, four’. He had
been taught to say ‘one, two, three, four,’ by his mother, but the
first lesson in counting had clearly failed to convey more than
the difference between unity and multitude. The series of verbal
sounds, ‘two, three, four,’ probably helped him to realise the idea
of number, and in any case it was a forcible way of expressing it.</p>

<p class='c001'>As suggested above, primitive substantive-forms probably do
duty as verbs in the language of the child as in that of primitive
man. True verbs as differentiated signs of action came into use
at the date we are speaking of, and these began to give to the
boy’s embryonic speech something of the structure, the sentence.</p>

<p class='c001'>As one might naturally conjecture from the disproportionate
amount of attention manifestly bestowed on this child, he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>all the masterfulness of his kind, and the first form of the verb
to be used was the imperative. Thus by the end of the
twentieth month he had quite a little vocabulary for giving
effect to his sovereign volitions, such as, ‘On!’ (get on),
‘Ook!’ (look). It was in the use of commands that he
showed some of his finest inventiveness. Thus when just
seventeen months old he wanted his mother to get up. He began
by lifting his hands and saying, ‘Ta, ta!’ (sign of going out).
Finding this to be ineffective, he tried, with a comical simulation
of muscular strength, to pull or push her up, at the same
time exclaiming, “Up!” The lifting of the hands looked like
a bit of picturesque gesture-language. In his twenty-first
month he acquired a new and telling word of command, <i>viz.</i>,
‘Way’ (<i>i.e.</i>, out of my way), as well as the invaluable sign of
prohibition, ‘Dō’ (<i>i.e.</i>, don’t), both of which, it need hardly be
said, he began to bandy about pretty freely, especially in his
dealings with his sister.</p>

<p class='c001'>A landmark in C.’s intellectual development is set by the
father at the age of nineteen and a half months. Before this
date he had only made rather a lame attempt at sentence-building
by setting his primitive names in juxtaposition, <i>e.g.</i>,
‘Tit, mamma, poo,’ which being interpreted means, ‘Sister
and mamma, have pudding’. But now he took a very
decided step in advance, and by a proper use of a verb as such
constructed what a logician calls a proposition with its subject
and predicate. He happened to observe his sister venting
some trouble in the usual girlish fashion, and exclaimed, ‘Tit
ki’ (sister is crying), following up the assertion by going
towards her and trying to stop her. Another example of a
sentence rather more complex in structure which occurred a
fortnight later had also to do with his sister. He saw her
lying on her back on the grass, and exclaimed with all the
signs of joyous wonder, ‘Tit dow ga!’ (<i>i.e.</i>, sister is down on
the grass). Evidently the unpredictable behaviour of this member
of his family deeply impressed the young observer. It is
noticeable that these first exceptional efforts in assertion were
prompted by feeling.<a id='r305' /><a href='#f305' class='c011'><sup>[305]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>These first tentatives in verbal assertion, we are told,
sounded very odd owing to the slowness of the delivery and
the stress impartially laid on each word. C. had as yet no
inkling of the subtleties of rhetoric, and was too much taken
up with the weighty business of expressing thought somehow
to trouble about such niceties as relative emphasis, and variation
of pitch and pace.</p>

<p class='c001'>As a rule, remarks the father, it was surprising how
suddenly, as it seemed, the boy hit on the right succession of
verbal sounds. Only very rarely would he stumble, as when
after having seen a fly taken out of his milk, and on being
subsequently asked whether he would not be glad to see his
sister on her return from a visit, he said, ‘(Y)es, tell Ningi
’bout fy’ (Yes, Ningi will tell her about the fly).<a id='r306' /><a href='#f306' class='c011'><sup>[306]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The impulse to express himself, to communicate his
experiences and observations to others, seemed to be all-possessing
just now, and odd enough it was to note the make-shifts
to which he was now and again driven. One day, when
just twenty and a half months old, he sat in a chair with a
heavyish book which he found it hard to hold up. He turned
to his mother and said solemnly, “Boo go dow” (the book
is going down or falling). Then, as if remarking a look of
unintelligence in his audience, he threw it down and exclaimed,
“Dat!” by which vigorous proceeding he gave a vivid illustration
of his meaning.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was noticeable that he would at this time play at
sentence-making in a varied imitation of others’ assertions,
thereby hitting out some quaint fancy which appeared to
amuse him. Thus when told that there is a man on the horse
he would say, ‘Ningi on horse,’ ‘Tit on horse,’ and so forth.
Such playful practice in utterance probably furthers the growth
of readiness and precision in the use of sentences.</p>

<p class='c001'>The point in the intellectual growth of a child at which he
acquires such a mastery of language as to carry on a sustained
conversation is a proud and happy one for the fond parent. In
the case of C. this date, twenty-three months and ten days, is,
of course, marked with red letters. He made a great noise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>running about and shouting in his bedroom. His mother
came in and rebuked him in the usual form (‘Naughty!
naughty!’). He thereupon replied, “Tit mak noi” (Sister
makes the noise). Mother (seriously): “Sister is at school”.
C., with a still bolder look: “Mamma make noi”. Mother
(with convulsive effort to suppress laughing, still more emphatically):
“No, mamma was in the other room”. C. (looking archly
at his doll, known as May): “May make noi”. This sally was
followed by a good peal of boyish laughter.</p>

<p class='c001'>The father evidently feels that this incident is highly
suggestive of a lack of moral sense. So he thinks it well
to add to the observation that the child had all the normal
moral sensibility. But of this more presently.</p>

<p class='c001'>We may now pass to the comparatively few observations
(other than those already dealt with under verbal utterance)
which refer to the child’s feelings. As already remarked, he
was, like most other children, peevish and cross in the first
year, and I regret to say that the diary refers more than once
to violent outbursts of infantile rage in the second year also.
Here is one sample entry (<i>æt.</i> nineteen months): Feelings of
greediness, covetousness and spite begin to manifest themselves
with alarming distinctness. When asked to give up a bit
of pudding he says, “No,” in a coy, shy sort of manner, turning
away. When further pressed he grows angry. On the other
hand, he clamours for his sister’s dolls, and bears refusal with
very ill grace. When, given up as hopelessly naughty, he
is handed over to the nurse, and carried out of the room by
this long-suffering person, he ferociously slaps her on the
face. This slap appears not to be a pure invention, his sister
having been driven more than once to visit him with this
chastisement. He will also go up and slap his sister when
she cries. He probably puts the nurse who carries him out
and the sister who cries in the same category of naughty
people. Sometimes he seems quite overpowered by vexation
of spirit, and will lie down on the floor on his face and have a
good, long, satisfying cry.</p>

<p class='c001'>The child’s timidity has already been touched on. At the
age of sixteen months, we are told, the sight of the drawing of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>a lion accompanied by roaring noises imitated by the father
would greatly terrify him, driving him to his mother, in whose
bosom he would hide his face, drawing down his under lip in
an ominous way. Two months later the diary tells us that the
child has had a fright. One day a lady called with a dog,
which secreted itself under the table, and later on suddenly
rushed out and made for Master C. The shock was such that
since that time whenever he hears a strange noise he runs to
his mother, exclaiming, ‘Bow-wow!’ in a terrified manner.</p>

<p class='c001'>Before the close of the year, however, he began to show a
manlier temper. The sight of a dog still made him run
towards his mother and cling to her, but as soon as the
animal moved off he would look up into her face laughingly
and repeat the consolatory saying which she herself had taught
him: “Ni (nice) bow-wow! bow-wow like Ningi”. In this
humble fashion did he make beginning at the big task of
manning himself to face the terrors of things.</p>

<p class='c001'>As pointed out above, he extended his dislike to sudden
and loud noises to inanimate objects. Thus in the last week of
the year he was evidently put out, if not actually frightened,
by hearing distant thunder; and about the same date, as we
have seen, he showed a similar dislike to the sea when first
taken near it. He would not approach it for some days, and
he cried when he saw his father swimming in it.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is sad in going through the pages of the diary to note
that there is scarcely any observation during this second year
on the development of kindly feelings. One would have
supposed that with all the affection and care lavished on him
C. might have manifested a little tenderness in response.
The only incident put down under the head of social feeling in
this year is the following (<i>æt.</i> twenty months): “When he
eats porridge in the morning at the family breakfast he takes a
look round and says: ‘Mamma, Tit, papa, Ningi,’ appearing to
be pleased at finding himself sharing in a common enjoyment.
This (continues the narrator) is a step onward from the anti-social
attitude which he took up not long since when some of
his mother’s egg was given to his sister and he shouted
prohibitively: ‘No! no!’”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>The worthy parent appears to be making the most of very
small mercies here. Yet in justice to this child it must be
said that he seems to have shown even at this tender age
the rudiment of a conscience. The father is satisfied, indeed,
that he displayed an instinctive respect for command or
law. “Thus,” he says, “when sixteen months old the child
hung down his head or hid it in his mother’s breast when for
the first time I scolded him.” He goes on to say that after
having been forbidden to do a thing, as to touch the coal
scuttle or to take up his food with his fingers, he will stop just
as he is going to do it, and take on a curious look of timidity
or shamefacedness.</p>

<p class='c001'>He seemed, too, before the end of the second year, to be
getting to understand something of the meaning of that
recurrent nursery-word ‘naughty,’ and the less frequent ‘good’.
When seventeen months old his father tried him, on what
looked like the approach of an outburst of temper, with a
‘Cliffy, be good!’ uttered in a firm peremptory manner. The
child’s noise was at once arrested, and on the father’s asking:
‘Is Cliffy good?’ he answered, ‘Ea,’ his sign for ‘yes’. A
little later he showed that he strongly disliked being called
naughty,—vigorously remonstrating when so described with an
emphatic, ‘No, no! good!’ He seems to have followed the
usual childish order in beginning to apply “naughty” to
others, his sister more particularly, much sooner than “good”.
It was not till the middle of the twenty-first month that he
recognised moral desert in this long-suffering sister. After a
little upset of temper on her part, when the crying was over,
he remarked in a quiet approving tone, ‘Goo!’ and on being
asked by his mother who was good he answered, ‘Tit’.</p>

<p class='c001'>As our example of his dawning powers of conversation may
suggest, C. early developed the childish sense of fun. Most if
not all children love pretence or make-believe. Here is an
example of this childish tendency. When about eighteen
months old during a short visit to his father’s room C.
happened to be walking in the direction of the door. His
father at once said, ‘Ta ta,’ just as if the child were really
going away. C. instantly entered into the joke, repeating the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>‘ta ta,’ moving towards the door, then returning, and so
renewing the pretty little fraud.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sometimes, as parents know, this impish love of make-believe
comes very inconveniently into conflict with discipline
and authority. One day, about the same date, he got hold of a
photograph portrait of an uncle of his. His mother bade him
give it up to her. He walked towards her looking serious
enough, nearly put it into her hand, and then suddenly drew
his hands back laughing.</p>

<p class='c001'>In other examples of laughter given in this chapter we see
something very like contempt. When two years and eight
months old he was observed to laugh out loudly on surveying
his small india-rubber horse, the head of which had somehow got
twisted back and caught between the hind legs and the tail.
He then waxed tender and said pityingly, “Poor gee-gee!”
“Here,” writes the father in his most ponderous manner, “we
see an excellent example of the capricious and variable attitude
of the childish mind towards its toys, an attitude closely
paralleled by that of the savage towards his fetich.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The two or three notes on the development of the active
powers have to do with the application of intelligence to manual
and other performances. Here is one. At the age of seventeen
months he was sitting at table with the family when he found
himself in want of some bread and butter. He tried his
customary petition, ‘Bup,’ but to no purpose. He then
stretched out his hand towards the bread knife, repeating the
request. A day or two after this the father put his inventive
powers to a severer proof. He placed the knife out of
his reach. When the desire for more recurred he grew very
impatient, looking towards his father and saying ‘Bup’ with
much vehemence of manner. At length, getting more excited,
he bethought him of a new expedient and pointed authoritatively
to his empty plate.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some of these practical tentatives were rather amusing.
One day, just a month after the date of the last incident, he
had two keys, one in each hand. With one of these he proceeded
to try the keyhole of the door, oddly enough, however,
holding it by the wrong end and inserting the handle. Now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>came the difficulty of turning it. Two hands at the very least
were needed, but unhappily the other hand was engaged with
the second key, which was not to be relinquished for an instant.
So the little fellow, with the inventive resource of a monkey
(the father naturally says of an ‘engineer’), proceeded to use
his teeth as pincers, clutching the obstinate key between these
and trying to turn it with the head. At this date he had acquired
considerable skill in the manipulation of door handles and keys.
A certain cupboard was a peculiarly fascinating mystery,
appealing at once to the desires of the flesh and to a disinterested
curiosity, and he was soon master of the ‘open
sesame’ to its spacious and obscure recesses.</p>

<p class='c001'>By far the most respectable exhibition of will about this
time was in the way of self-restraint. I have already remarked
how he would try to pull himself together when prostrated
by fear of the dog. A similarly quaint attempt at self-mastery
would occur during his outbreaks of temper. The
father says he had got into the way, when the child was inclined
to be impatient and teasing, of putting up his finger, lowering
his brow, and saying with emphasis: ‘Cliffy, be good!’ After
this when inclined to be naughty he would suddenly and quite
spontaneously pull himself up, hold up his finger and lower
his brow as if reprimanding himself. “The observation is
curious,” writes the father, in his graver manner, “as suggesting
that self-restraint may begin by an imitation of the action of
extraneous authority.”<a id='r307' /><a href='#f307' class='c011'><sup>[307]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'><i>Third Year.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>One cannot help regretting on entering upon the third
chapter of C.’s biography that the father gives us no account of
his physical development. This is a desideratum not only
from a scientific but from a literary point of view. Biographers
rightly describe the look of their hero, and, if possible, they aid
the imagination of their reader by a portrait. The reader of
this child’s history has nothing, not even a bare reference to
height, by which he can form an image of the concrete personality
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>whose sayings and doings are here recorded; and these
sayings and doings begin now to grow really interesting.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is very little in the notes of this year respecting
the growth of observation. When the child was two years
five months old the father appears to have made a rather lame
attempt to determine the order in which he learnt the
colours. He says that he placed the several colours before him
and taught him the names, and found as a result that the
order of acquisition was the following: red, blue, yellow, and
green. It is added that blue was distinguished some time
before green. His observations, taken along with those of
Preyer and others, are interesting as seeming to suggest that
the order in which the colours are learnt differs considerably in
the case of individual children.<a id='r308' /><a href='#f308' class='c011'><sup>[308]</sup></a> In the eighth month of this
year we find a note to the effect that the boy discriminates
and recognises colour well. This is illustrated by the fact
that he at once calls grey with a slightly greenish tinge
‘green’. The connexion between the possession of suitable
vocables and explicit discrimination is seen in the fact that
whereas he applies the name blue not only to the several
varieties of that colour but also to violet, he uses “red” as
the name for certain reds only, excepting pink, which is called
“pink,” and deep purple red, which is called “brown”.</p>

<p class='c001'>The third year is epoch-making in the history of memory.
It is now that impressions begin to work themselves into the
young consciousness so deeply and firmly that they become a
part of the permanent stock-in-trade of the mind. The earliest
recollections of most of us do not reach back beyond this date,
if indeed so far. In C.’s case the father was able to observe
this fixing and consolidating of impressions. For instance,
when two years and two months old he had been staying for a
month or so at a farmhouse in a little sea-side village, D——,
where there was a sheep dog yclept Bob. Some three and a half
months later he happened, during one of his walks in his
London suburb, to see a sheep dog, whereupon he remarked,
‘Dat old Bob, I dink’. A week or two after this, on seeing
the picture of a wind-mill, he remarked, "Dat like down at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>D——". Later on, six months after this visit, on being asked
what honey was, he remarked that he had had some at D——.
Nine months after this visit his father was talking to him
about the game of cricket. He then said, "<em>Oh</em>, yes (his
favourite expression just now when he understands), I
’member, Jingo ran after ball down at D——". As a matter of
fact his father and friends used to play tennis at D——, and
Jingo, the sheep dog, did pretend to ‘field’ the balls, often in
a highly inconvenient fashion.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is evident from these quotations that the experiences at
D——, just at the beginning of the third year, had woven
themselves into the tissue of his permanent memory. The
father remarks in a footnote that C. retains a certain recollection
of D—— at present, that is to say, in his fourteenth year.</p>

<p class='c001'>These lively recallings show a growth of imaginative power,
and this was seen in other ways too. Thus it is remarked
by the father in the fourth month of the year that he was getting
much comfort from anticipation. If there are apples or other
things on the table which he likes but must not have, he will
philosophically remark, “Ningi have apples by-and-by when he
big boy”. He says this with much emphasis, rising at the end
to a shouting tone, and half breaking out into jubilant laughter.</p>

<p class='c001'>The childish power of vivid imaginative realisation was
abundantly illustrated in his play. Here is a sample (end of
fourth month). His sister went to the end of the room and
said (with a reference to their recent visit to the sea-side): ‘I’m
going far away on the beach’. He then began to whisper something,
and went under the table and said distinctly: ‘Ningi
go away from Tit, far away on beach’. He repeated this with
tremulous voice, and at length burst out crying. He wept
also when his sister pretended to do the same, so that these
little tragic representations had to be stopped as dangerously
exciting.</p>

<p class='c001'>It has often been said that ‘fibbing’ in young children is the
outcome of a vivid imagination. C. illustrated this. As the
example given under the second year shows, his daring in inventing
untruth and passing it off as truth was pure play, and
frankly shown to be so by the accompaniment of a hearty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>laugh. This tendency to invent continued to assert itself.
Thus when (in the eighth month) he is asked a question, as,
“Who told you so?” and has no suitable answer ready
he will say, ‘Dolly,’ showing his sense of the fun of the thing
by a merry laugh. The father remarks that it is a little difficult
to bring heavy moral artillery to bear on this playful
fibbing which is evidently intended much more to astonish than
to deceive.<a id='r309' /><a href='#f309' class='c011'><sup>[309]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>We may now see what progress C. was making in thinking
power during this year. It is during the third year that children
may be expected to get a much better hold on the slippery
forms of language, and at the same time to show in connexion
with a freer and more extensive use of language a finer and
deeper insight into the manifold relations of things.</p>

<p class='c001'>In C.’s case, to judge by the journal, the progress of
speech advanced at a normal pace, neither hurrying nor yet
greatly loitering. Articulation, the father remarks early in the
year, has got much more precise, only a few sounds seeming to
occasion difficulty, as for example the initial <em>s</em>, which he transforms
into an aspirate, saying, for example, ‘huga’ for sugar.</p>

<p class='c001'>A noticeable linguistic advance is registered in the fourth
month of the year, <i>viz.</i>, a kind of sudden and energetic raid on
the names of objects and persons. “He is always asking the
names of things now (writes our chronicler). Thus, after
calling a common object, as a brush, by its name he will ask
me, ‘What is the <em>name</em> of this?’ Perhaps he thinks that
everything has its own exclusive or ‘proper’ name as he has.
He is beginning to note, too, that some things have more
than one proper name, that his mother, for example, though
called ‘ma’ by himself, is addressed by her Christian name
by me, and so forth. When asked, ‘What is Ningi’s name?’
he now answers, ‘Kifford’.”</p>

<p class='c001'>What is far more significant, he now (<i>æt.</i> two years three
months) began to use ‘you’ in addressing his father or mother,
also ‘me’ and ‘I’. But these changes are so momentous
and epoch-making in the history of the young intelligence
that they will have to be specially considered later on.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>Like other children he showed a fine contempt for the
grammatical distinctions of pronominal forms. Thus ‘me’ was
used for ‘mine,’ ‘her’ for ‘she,’ ‘she’s’ for ‘hers,’ ‘him’
for ‘he’ and for ‘his,’ ‘us’ for ‘our,’ and so forth.<a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c011'><sup>[310]</sup></a>  It
is pretty clear that none of these solecisms was due to an
imitation of others’ incorrect speech, and they appear to show
the action of the principle of biological economy, a few word-sounds
being made to do duty for a number of relations (<i>e.g.</i>,
in the use of ‘me’ for ‘my’), and familiar word-sounds being
modified according to analogy of other modifications where older
people use a quite new form (‘she’s’ for ‘hers’). A similar disposition
to simplify and rationalise the tongue of his ancestors
showed itself in the use of verbs. Thus, if his mother said,
‘Cliffy, you are not good,’ he would reply in a perfectly rational
manner, “Yes, I are”. “It was odd,” writes the father, “to
hear him bring out in solemn judge-like tones such terrible
solecisms as ‘Him haven’t,’ yet there was a certain logical
method in his lawlessness.” Another simplification on which
he hit in common with other children was the use of ‘did’ as
a sign of past tense, thus saving himself all the trouble of
understanding the irregular behaviour of our verbs.<a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c011'><sup>[311]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>One or two quaint applications of words are noted. Thus
towards the end of the third month of this year he took to
using ‘cover’ in a somewhat puzzling fashion. Thus he once
pointed to the back of his hand and remarked, ‘No milk on
this cover’. The father suspects that the term connoted for
his consciousness an outside part or the outer surface of an
object.</p>

<p class='c001'>A very noticeable improvement took place in the forming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>of sentences. All sorts of questions (writes the chronicler) are
now put correctly and neatly, as, ‘Where are you going to?’
‘Where did that come from?’ He is now striking out most
ambitiously in new and difficult directions, not fighting shy
even of such school-horrors as conditional clauses (as they used
to be called, at least). Very funny it must have been to watch
these efforts, and the ingenuities of construction to which the
little learner found himself driven. For example, he happened
one morning (end of fourth month) when in his father’s bedroom
to hear a knocking in the adjoining room. He walked
about the room remarking to himself, ‘I can’t make out somebody,’
which seemed his own original fashion of avoiding the
awkwardness of our elaborate form, “I can’t make out who the
person is (that is knocking)”. A still quainter illustration of
the skill with which he found his way out of linguistic difficulties
is the following. His sister once said to him (first week
of fifth month), ‘You had better not do that,’ whereupon he
replied, “I think me better will”. Here is a sample of his
mode of dealing with conditionals (end of sixteenth month),
“If him (a tree) would be small, I would climb up”.</p>

<p class='c001'>His highly individualised language, remarks the father, was
rendered more picturesque by the recurrence of certain odd
expressions which he picked up and applied in his own royal
fashion. One of these was, “Well, it might be different,”
which he often used when corrected for a fault, and on other
occasions as a sort of formula of protestation against what he
thought to be an exaggerated statement.</p>

<p class='c001'>We may now notice some new manifestations of thinking
power. All thought, we are told, proceeds by the finding out
of similarities and dissimilarities. C. continued to note the resemblances
of things. Thus one day (end of second month)
he noticed the dog Jingo breathing quickly after a smart run
and observed, ‘Like puff-puff’. But what was much more
noticeable this year was the boy’s impulse to draw distinctions
and contrasts. It may certainly be said in his case that
likeness was distinctly apprehended before difference, that
in the development of his rhetoric the antithesis followed the
simile. One of the first contrasts to <a id='corr441.38'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='imprss'>impress</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_441.38'><ins class='correction' title='imprss'>impress</ins></a></span> the tender consciousness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>of children is that of size. This comes out among
other ways in their habit of setting their own puny persons in
antithesis to big grown-up folk, a habit sufficiently attested
by the recurring expressions, “When I am big,” “When I
am a man”. C., like other children, took to denoting a
contrast of size by a figurative extension of the relation,
mamma—baby. Thus it was noted (end of seventh month)
that he would call a big tree “mamma tree,” and a shrub
“baby tree”. One day he pointed to the clock on the mantel-piece
and talked of the ‘big mamma clock’. He had, it seems,
just before been playing with his father’s watch, which he also
called clock.<a id='r312' /><a href='#f312' class='c011'><sup>[312]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This love of contrasting appeared in a striking manner in
connexion with the use of propositions. If, for example (third
month), his father says, “That’s a little watch,” he at once
brings out the point of the statement by adding, ‘That not a
big watch’. The same perception of contrast would sometimes
help him to take the edge off a disagreeable prohibition
when unguardedly worded. Thus when told one day not to
make much noise, he considered and rejoined, “Make <em>little</em>
noise”.</p>

<p class='c001'>A more subtle perception of contrast betrayed itself towards
the end of the ninth month. His father had been speaking to
him of the little calf which made a big noise. He mentally
turned over this astonishing bit of contrariness in the order of
things, and then observed with a sage gravity, “Big calf not
make little noise,” which so far as the limited faculties of the
observer could say appeared to mean that the contrast between
size and sound did not hold all round, that the big sound
emerging from the little thing was an exception to the order of
nature.</p>

<p class='c001'>In connexion with this habit of opposing qualities and
statements reference may be made to the curious manner in
which the boy expressed negation. It was evidently a difficulty
for him to get hold of the negative particle, and to deny
straight away, so to speak. At first (beginning of the year)
he seemed to indicate negation or rejection merely by tone of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>voice. Thus he would say about something which he evidently
did not like, ‘Ningi like that,’ with a peculiar querulous
tone which was apparently equivalent to the appendage ‘N.B.
ironical’. About a fortnight later he expressed negation by
first making the correlative affirmation and adding ‘No,’ thus:
"Ningi like go in water—no!" A week later, it is noted,
‘no’ was prefixed to the statement, as when he shouted, ‘No,
no, naughty Jingo,’ in contradiction of somebody who had
called the dog naughty. Towards the end of the third month
‘not’ came to be used as an alternative for ‘no’ which little
by little it displaced.</p>

<p class='c001'>The father remarks that C.’s sister had had a similar trick
of opposing statements, <i>e.g.</i>, “Dat E.’s cup, not mamma’s
cup”. He then proceeds to observe in his somewhat heavy
didactic manner that these facts are of curious psychological
and logical interest, showing us that negation follows affirmation,
and can at first only be carried out by a direct mental
confronting of an affirmation, and so forth.<a id='r313' /><a href='#f313' class='c011'><sup>[313]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>As already shown by the reference to the use of ‘somebody’
C.’s thought was growing slightly more abstract. Yet how
slow this advance was is illustrated in his way of dealing with
time-relations, some of the most difficult, as it would seem,
for the young mind to grapple with. At the end of the second
month the ideas of time, we are told, were growing more exact,
so far at least that he was able to distinguish a present time
from both a past and a future. He called the present variously
‘now,’ ‘a day’ (to-day) or ‘dis morning’.<a id='r314' /><a href='#f314' class='c011'><sup>[314]</sup></a> The present
seemed, so far as the father could judge, to be conceived of as
a good slice of time. ‘To-morrow’ and ‘by-and-by’ now served
to express the idea of futurity, the former referring to a nearer
and more definitely conceived tract of time than the latter.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>That the child had no clear apprehension of our time-divisions
is seen not only in his loose employment of ‘dis morning,’ but
in his habitual confusion of the names of meals, as in calling
dinner ‘tea,’ tea ‘dinner’ or ‘breakfast,’ and so forth.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another abstruse idea for the child’s mind is that of absence.
It would seem as if this were thought of at first as a disappearance.
As all mothers know, when a child is asked where somebody
is he answers, ‘All gone’. C., on his return from D——
(end of second month), when asked where the people and the
highly interesting Jingo were, would say, ‘All gone,’ and sometimes
add picturesquely, ‘in the puff-puff’.<a id='r315' /><a href='#f315' class='c011'><sup>[315]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The acquisition of clearer ideas about self and others has
been touched on in connexion with the growth of the boy’s
language. The first use of ‘I’ and the contemporaneous first
use of ‘you’ (end of third month) seem to point to a new
awakening of the intelligence to the mystery of self, and of its
unique position in relation to other things. There is to the
father evidently something pathetic in the gradual abandonment
of the self-chosen name, ‘Ningi,’ of the early days, and
the adoption of the common-place ‘I’ of other people. But
we need not attend to his sentimental musings on this point.
The exchange, we are told, was effected gradually, as if to
make it easier to his hearers. At first (beginning of year) we
have ‘me’ brought on the scene, which, be it observed, did
duty both for ‘me’ and for ‘my’.<a id='r316' /><a href='#f316' class='c011'><sup>[316]</sup></a> Later on followed ‘I,’ as an
occasional substitute for ‘me,’ as if he were beginning to see a
difference between the two, though unable to say wherein
precisely it lay. Within less than a month, we are told, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>child was beginning to use “Kikkie” as his name in place
of “Ningi,” which “Kikkie” was afterwards improved into
“Kifford”. “It was evident (writes the narrator) that in
venturing on the slippery ground of ‘I’ and ‘you’ he experienced
a sudden accession of manly spirit, as a result of which he began
to despise the ‘Ningi’ of yore.” But dear old ‘Ningi’ did not
go out all at once, and we read so late as the end of the
third month of his amusing his mother when standing on
the window-sill of the nursery by remarking thoughtfully,
“How am I, Ningi, come down?” Here, it would seem
evident, the addition of ‘Ningi’ was intended to help the
faculties of his mother in case this still puzzling “I” should
prove too much for them. By the end of the fourth month we
read that ‘I’ was growing less shy, not merely coming on the
scene in familiar and safe verbal companionship, as in expressions
like ‘I can,’ but boldly pushing its way alone or in new
combinations.<a id='r317' /><a href='#f317' class='c011'><sup>[317]</sup></a> By the sixth month (<i>æt.</i> two and a half) the
name Ningi may be said to have disappeared from his
vocabulary. His rejection of it was formally announced at the
age of two years seven and a half months. On being asked at
this date whether he was Ningi he answered, “No, my name
Kiffie”. He then added, “Ningi name of another little boy,”
very much as in a remarkable case of double personality
described by M. Pierre Janet, the transformed personality looking
back on the original observed, “That good woman is not
myself”. He looked roguish in saying this, as if there were
something funny in the idea of altered personality. The
determination to be conventional was shown at the same date
in the fact that when, for example, the mother or father, following
the old habit, would bid him go and ask the nurse to
wash “Cliffie’s hands,” he would, in delivering the message,
substitute “my hands”. By the end of the year ‘I’ came to be
habitually used for self, as in answering a question, <i>e.g.</i>, “Who
did this or that?” Tyrannous custom had now completely
prevailed over infantile preferences.</p>

<p class='c001'>During the third year C. seemed determined to prove to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>his parents and sister that he had attained the age of reason.
He began to ply these well-disposed persons with all manner
of questionings. Sometimes, indeed, as when in the case already
referred to he would ask for the names of things just
after calling them by their names, the long-suffering mother
was half inclined to regret the acquisition of speech, so much
did it present itself at this stage in the light of an instrument of
torture. But the child’s questionings were rarely attributable
to a spirit of persecution or to sheer “cussedness”. He began
in the usual manner of children to ask: ‘Who made this and
that?’ (early in the fourth month). That there is a simple process
of reasoning behind this question is seen in his sometimes
suggesting an answer thus: “Who made papa poorly?
Blackberries;” where there was obviously a reference to an
unpleasant personal experience. His mind about this time
seemed greatly exercised in the matter of sickness and health.
One day (middle of sixth month) walking out with his mother
he met a man, whereupon ensued this dialogue: C. ‘Is that
a poorly gentleman?’ M. ‘No.’ C. ‘Is that a well gentleman?’
M. ‘Yes.’ C. ‘Then who made him well?’ From
which (writes the father) it would look as if, just as Plato
could only conceive of pleasure as a transition from pain,
Master C. could only conceive of health as a process of convalescence.<a id='r318' /><a href='#f318' class='c011'><sup>[318]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Another way of prying into the origin of things seems
worth mentioning. Having found out that certain pretty
things in the house had been “bought,” he proceeded with
the characteristic recklessness of the childish mind to assume that
all nice things come to us this way. One day (middle of third
month) he asked his father, “Who bought lady?” lady being
an alabaster figure of Sappho. The father then asked him, and
he answered: “Mamma”. Asked further where, he replied:
“In town”. This looked like romancing, but it is hard to
draw the line between childish romancing and serious thought.
He may have really inferred that the alabaster lady had come
to the house that way. A still funnier example of the application
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>of his purchasing idea occurred at the date, three
months and one week. Stroking his mother’s face he said:
“Nice dear mother, who bought you?” What, asks the
father, did he understand by "bought"? Perhaps only some
mysterious way of obtaining possession of nice pretty things.</p>

<p class='c001'>The other form of reason-hunting question, ‘What for?’ or
‘Why?’ came to be used about the same time as “Who
made?” etc. In putting these questions he would sometimes
suggest answers of a deliciously childish sort (as the writer has
it). Thus one day (beginning of fourth month) he saw his
father putting small numbered labels on a set of drawers, and
after his customary “What dat for?” added half inquiringly,
“To deep drawers nice and warm?” C. would pester his
parents by asking not only why things were as they were, but
why they were not different from what they were. Thus (end
of third month) on seeing in a nursery book a picture of
Reynard the fox waving his hat he asked in his slow emphatic
way: ‘Why not dat fox put on his hat?’ In a similar way
he would ask his mother why she did not go to school, and so
forth.<a id='r319' /><a href='#f319' class='c011'><sup>[319]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>With this questioning there went a certain amount of confident
assertion respecting the reasons of things. At first C.
proceeded modestly, reproducing reasons given by an adequate
authority. Thus when told during his stay at D—— that he
would not go into the sea to-day, he would supplement the
announcement by adding the reason as given before by his
mother, <i>e.g.</i>, “’Cause it’s too cold,” or, “’Cause big waves to-day”.
Very soon, however, he took a step forward and
discovered reasons for himself. One day (end of fifth month)
his father was seating him at table, and was about to add a
second cushion to the chair when he remarked in his gravest
of manners, “I can’t put my leg in, you know (<i>i.e.</i>, under the
table), if me be higher”. Here is another of these specimens of
reasoning, dating two weeks later, and based like the first on
direct observation. His father was walking out with him on
the famous Heath of their suburb. The former, probably more
than half lost in one of his trains of philosophic speculation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>observed absent-mindedly, “Why are these babas (sheep) running
away?” C. promptly took up the question and answered with
vigour, “’Cause the bow-wow dare with man”. As a matter
of fact a man was approaching with a small dog, which the
father in his reverie had failed to see.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of course, the reasoning was not always so consonant with
our standard as in these two examples. C. appears to have
had his own ideas about the way in which things come about.
For example, he seems to have argued, like certain scholastic
logicians, that the effect must resemble the cause. At least,
after finding out that his milk came from the cow, he referred
the coldness of his milk one morning (towards end of fourth
month) to the coldness of the cow,—which property of that
serviceable quadruped was, of course, a pure invention of his
own. Just three months later he came out one morning
with the momentous announcement, "Milk comes from the
white cow down at D——"; and on being asked by his ever-attentive
father what sort of milk the brown cow gave, instantly
replied, ‘Brown milk’; where, again, it must be admitted, he
came suspiciously near romancing.</p>

<p class='c001'>He seems, further, to have shown slight respect for the
logical maxim that the same effect may be brought about in
more than one way. For C. nature was delightfully simple,
and everything happened in one way, and in one way only.
So that, for example, when during a walk (end of sixth month)
his glove happened to slip off, he proceeded in a most hasty
and unfair manner to set down the catastrophe to the malignity
of the wind, exclaiming, “Naughty wind to blow off glove”.</p>

<p class='c001'>A like want of maturity of judgment in dealing with the
subtle connexions of nature’s processes showed itself in other
ways. Thus he argued as if the same agency would always
bring about like results, whatever the material dealt with. An
amusing illustration of this occurred in the latter half of the
tenth month. He was observed towards the end of a meal
pouring water on sundry bits of bread on his plate, and on
being asked why he was doing this, said: ‘To melt them, of
course’.</p>

<p class='c001'>One of his thoroughly original ideas was that other things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>besides living ones grow bigger with time. One day (middle
of sixth month) he began to use a short stick as a walking-stick.
His mother objected that it was not big enough, on
which he observed: “Me use it for walking-stick when stick
be bigger”. In like manner just a month later he remarked,
<em>apropos</em> of a watch-key which was too small for the father’s
watch, that it would be able to wind up the watch ‘when it
grow bigger’. So far as the father could observe it was only
little things which he thought would increase in size. It thus
looked, adds the father, like a kind of extension of the supreme
law of his own small person to the whole realm of wee and
despised objects.<a id='r320' /><a href='#f320' class='c011'><sup>[320]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>C. followed other children and the race which he so well represented
in supposing that sensation is not confined to the
animal world. Thus towards the end of the eleventh month
when warned in the garden not to touch a bee as it might sting,
he at once observed: “It might sting the flower”. “It is odd,”
interpolates the father here, “that C.’s sister, when, towards the
end of her fourth year, she was bidden not to touch a wasp on the
window-pane, had gone further than C. by suggesting that it
might sting the glass. Everything seems to live and to feel in
the child’s first fancy-created world.”<a id='r321' /><a href='#f321' class='c011'><sup>[321]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Towards the end of the year, it appears, C. developed considerable
smartness in logical fencings with his mother and
others, warding off unpleasant prohibitions by a specious display
of argument. For example, when told that something he
wanted would make him poorly, he rejoined: ‘I <em>am</em> poorly,’
evidently thinking that he had convicted his estimable parent
of what logicians call irrelevant conclusion.</p>

<p class='c001'>One cannot say that these first incursions into the domain
of logic do Master C. particular credit. Perhaps we may see
later on that he came to use his rational faculty with more
skill and precision, and to turn it to nobler uses than the invention
of subterfuges whereby he might get his wilful way.</p>

<p class='c001'>The notes on the development of the feelings continue to
be rather scanty. I will reproduce one or two of the more note-worthy.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>The visit to D—— was attended with a great change in
his feeling for animals. He no longer feared them. Jingo,
spite of his warlike name, was an amiable creature, and seems
to have reconciled him to the canine species. Cats, too, now
came in for special affection. He would watch the animals in
D——, horses, cows, and especially ducks, with quiet delight
for many minutes, imitating their sounds. Strange to say,
now that fear had gone he showed himself disposed to take
liberties with animals. Thus he would slap Jingo and even his
favourite cat in moments of displeasure, just as he and his
sister before him used to slap their dolls.</p>

<p class='c001'>A new emotion showed itself towards the end of the fourth
month, <i>viz.</i>, shyness. If his parents unguardedly spoke about
him at table he would hang down his head and put his hands
over his face. So far as the father could observe this expression
of shyness was unlearned. His sister, it appears, had
not been remarkable for the feeling. The father observes that
the fact of this new feeling synchronising with the acquisition
of the use of ‘I,’ ‘my,’ etc., seems to show that it was
connected with the growth of self-consciousness.</p>

<p class='c001'>His sense of fun continued to develop, though it still had
a decidedly rude and primitive character. When just four
months on in the year his father amused him by battering in
an old hat of his own. He broke into loud laughter at this
performance. We know, writes the observer, how the sight
of a hat in trouble convulses the grown mind. Can it be that
C. was already forming associations of dignity with this completion
and crown of human apparel?</p>

<p class='c001'>Tender emotion, as became a boy, perhaps, was in abeyance.
He rarely indulged in manifestations of love, or if he
did, it must have been towards his mother secretly in a confidence
that was never violated. Here is one of the few instances
recorded (beginning of eighth month). He happened
to see his own picture in his mother’s eye and said in a highly
sentimental tone: “Dear pitty little picture, I do love ’oo,”
and then proceeded to kiss his mother’s eyelid. It was little
things, as kittens, flowers, and so forth, which seemed to move
him to this occasional melting mood.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>The sympathetic feelings though still weak may be said to
be slowly developing. Thus in the first month of the year it
is remarked that he now thinks of his sister when absent, so
that if he has the highly-prized enjoyment of a biscuit he will
suggest that ‘Tit have bisc too’.</p>

<p class='c001'>This year witnessed the formation of more definite æsthetic
likings in the matter of colours and forms. His dislike for a
black cat and black things generally, may perhaps be called in
a way a preference of taste. In his animal picture-books, of
which he was now growing very fond, he showed a marked dislike
for a monkey with an open mouth, also for the rhinoceros, and
strong likings, on the other hand, for birds in general, also for
horses and zebras.</p>

<p class='c001'>He began to learn nursery rhymes, and showed a good ear
for rhyme. Thus in saying:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Goosey goosey gander,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where shall I wander?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>he was observed (end of tenth month) to correct the rhyme by
first pronouncing the <em>a</em> in “wander” less broadly than is our
wont, just as in “gander,” and then substituting the conventional
pronunciation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The moral side of the child’s nature appears during
this year to have undergone noticeable changes. The most
striking fact which comes out in the picture of the boy as
painted in the present chapter is the sudden emergence of self-will.
He began now to show himself a veritable rebel against
parental authority. Thus we read (about the end of the sixth
week) that when corrected for slapping Jingo, or other fault, he
would remain silent and half laugh in a cold contemptuous way,
which must have been shocking to his worthy parents. A
month later we hear of an alarming increase of self-will. He
would now strike each of these august persons, and follow up the
sacrilege with a profane laugh. As might be expected from his
general use of subterfuge about this time, he showed a lamentable
want of moral sensibility in trying to shirk responsibility.
Thus (middle of seventh month) he was noticed by his mother
putting a spill of paper over the fire-guard into the fire so as to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>light it. His mother at once said: “Ningi mustn’t do that”.
Whereupon he impudently retorted: “Ningi not doing that,
paper doing it”.<a id='r322' /><a href='#f322' class='c011'><sup>[322]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>All this is dreadful enough, yet it is probable that many
children go through a longer or shorter stage of rebellion, who
afterwards turn out to be well-behaved, respectable persons.
And, as his father is not slow to point out, C., even in these rebellious
outbursts, showed the rudiments of moral feeling in the
shape of a deep sensitiveness to injury and more definitely to
unjust treatment. Thus we are told (middle of seventh month)
that when his sister eats the leavings of his pudding or other
dainty he shows a well-marked moral indignation. He gets very
excited at such moments, his eyes dilating, his voice rising in
pitch, and his arms executing a good deal of violent gesticulation.
When scolded by his mother for doing a thing which he has only
appeared to do, he will turn and exclaim, with all the signs of
righteous wrath, “Mamma naughty say dat!” One day (end of
seventh month) when, after being very naughty, his mother had
to carry him upstairs, he broke out into a more than usually
violent fit of crying. His mother asked him what he meant
by making such a noise when being carried upstairs; whereupon
he replied, “’Cause you carry me up like a pig” (as represented
in one of his picture-books).</p>

<p class='c001'>There is nothing particularly meritorious in all this, yet it
is significant as showing how, in this third year, the consciousness
of self was developing not only on its intellectual but on
its moral side, as a sense of personal dignity and rightful claim,
which, after all, is a very essential element in a normal and
robust moral sentiment.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><i>Fourth Year.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>The reports of progress during the fourth year are still
scantier than their predecessors: perhaps the observer was
getting tired of his half-playful work. Nevertheless, there are
some interesting observations in this chapter also.</p>

<p class='c001'>C.’s observation seems to have been decidedly good, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>judge by an incident that occurred at the end of the third week
of the year. He had been to the Zoological Gardens. His
father asked him about the seals, and more particularly as to
whether they had legs. He answered at once, “No, papa,
they had foot-wings”. The chronicler is evidently proud of
this feat, and thinks it would have satisfied Professor Huxley
himself. But allowance must here as elsewhere be made for
parental pride.</p>

<p class='c001'>The child’s colour-sense, we are told about the same time,
was developing quite satisfactorily. He could now (end of fifth
week) discriminate and name intermediate shades of colour.
Thus he called a colour between yellow and green quite
correctly ‘yellowish green,’ and this way of naming colours
was, so far as the father could ascertain, quite spontaneous.
Later (three and a half months), on being questioned as to
violet, which he first said was blue, he replied correcting his
first answer, “and purple”. Later on (beginning of last
quarter), he could distinguish a ‘purplish blue’ from a “purplish
pink”.</p>

<p class='c001'>Along with a finer observation we find a more active and
inventive imagination. It was during this year that he began
to create fictitious persons and animals, and to surround himself
with a world, unseen by others, but terribly real to himself.</p>

<p class='c001'>About the middle of the third month he made his first essay
in story-fabrication. Considering that he had a lively and
imaginative elder sister, who was constantly regaling him with
fairy and other stories, this argues no particular precocity.
His first style in fiction was crude enough. He would pile up
epithets in a way that makes the most florid of journalistic
diction seem tame by comparison. Thus he would begin the
description of a dog by laying on a miscellaneous pile of colour-adjectives,
blue, red, green, black, white, and so forth. With
a similar disregard for verisimilitude and concentration of aim
on strong effect, he would pile up the agony in a story, relating,
for example, how the dog that had killed a rabbit (“bunny”)
had his head beaten off, was then drowned, and so on, through
a whole Iliad of canine calamity. Here is another example of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>his literary sensationalism (middle of ninth month). While he
and his father were taking a walk in the country, where the
family was staying, they found the feathers and bones of a bird
in a tiny cleft in the tree. The father thereupon began to
weave for him a little story about the unfortunate bird, how it
had taken shelter there one cold winter’s day weary and hungry,
and had grown too weak to get away. This did not satisfy
the strong palate of our young poet, who proceeded to improve
on the tragedy. “P’haps a snake there, p’haps dicky bird flew
there one cold winter day and snake ate it up, and then spit it
out again,” and so forth. “P’haps (he ended up) he (the bird)
thought there was nothing but wind (air) there.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He had, of course, his super-sensible world, made up of
mysterious beings of fairy-like nature, who, like the spirits of
primitive folk-lore, were turned to account in various ways.
The following incident (seven months one week) may illustrate
the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>modus operandi</i></span> of the child’s myth-making impulse. He
was eagerly looking forward to going to a circus. His father
told him that if it rained he would not be able to go, for
nobody could drive away the rain. Whereupon he instantly
remarked: “The Rainer can”. His father asked him who
this wonderful person was, and he replied: "A man who lives
in the forest—<em>my</em> forest—and has to drive rain away". The
expression “drive away” used by the father had been enough
to give this curious turn to his fancy.</p>

<p class='c001'>His fairy-world was concocted from a medley of materials
drawn from his observations of animals, his experiences at the
circus, including the ladies in beautifully tinted short dresses,
whom, with childish awe, he named ‘fairies,’ and the book-lore
that his sister was imparting to him from <cite>Stories of Uncle
Remus</cite>, and other favourites. In the ninth month he got into
the way of talking of his fairy-world, of the invisible fairies,
horses, rabbits, and so forth, to which he gave a local habitation
in the wall of his bedroom. When in a difficulty he thinks his
fairies can help him out. Nothing is too wonderful for their
powers: they can even solace his pitiful heart by making a
dead dog alive again. For the rest, like other imaginative
children, he peoples the places he knows, especially dark and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>mysterious ones, with imaginary beings. Thus one day, on
walking in a wood with his mother, he was overheard by her
talking to himself dreamily in this wise: “Here there used to
be wolves, but long, long time ago”.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is noticeable that at this same period of his myth-making
activity he began to speak of his dreams. He evidently takes
these dream-pictures for sensible realities, and when relating
a dream insists that he has actually seen the circus-horses and
fairies which appear to him when asleep. Possibly, writes
the father, this dreaming, as in the case of the primitive race,
had much to do in developing his intense belief in a supernatural
world. It may be added that during this same period
he was in the habit of seeing the forms of his animals, as lions,
“gee-gees,” in such irregular and apparently unsuggestive
groupings of line as those made by the cracks in the ceiling
of his nursery.<a id='r323' /><a href='#f323' class='c011'><sup>[323]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>There is little to note in the way of verbal invention. Here
is one amusing specimen (third week of third month). His
father asked him whether his toy-horse was tired, whereupon
he answered: ‘No, I make him untired’. This leads off the
writer to an abstruse logical discussion of “negative terms,”
and how it comes about that we do not all of us talk in C.’s
fashion and say ‘untired,’ ‘unfatigued’. Another quaint invention
was the use of ‘think’ as a noun. It was funny, writes
the father, to hear him rejecting his sister’s statements by the
contemptuous formula: “That’s only your thinks”.</p>

<p class='c001'>His understanding was slowly ripening in spite of his
free indulgence in the intoxicating pleasures of the imagination.
He could understand much that was said to him by the
aid of a liberal application of metaphor. Thus one day (end
of the year) his father when walking with him late in the
evening in a park where sheep were grazing told him that
animals did not want bed-clothes, but could lie on the
grass wet with dew and afterwards be dried with the sun.
He said: “Yes, the sun is their towel to make them dry”.</p>

<p class='c001'>The subtleties of time were still too much for him. In the
fourth month of the year when his sister was narrating an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>incident of the evening before and used the term ‘yesterday,’
he corrected her saying: “No, E., last night”. Yet he was
now beginning to penetrate into the mysteries of the subject.
His father happened one day (end of seventh month) to speak
of to-morrow. C. then asked: “When is to-morrow? To-morrow
morning?” He then noticed that his hearers were
remarking on his question, and proceeded to expound his own
view of these wonderful things. “There are two kinds of
to-morrow, to-morrow morning and this morning;” and then
added with the sagest of looks: “To-morrow morning is to-morrow
<em>now</em>”.</p>

<p class='c001'>At this the father tells us both he and the mother were
sorely puzzled, and if one may be allowed to read between the
lines, it is not improbable that the latter must have indulged
in some such exclamation as this: “There! this comes of
your stimulating the child’s brains too much”. However this
be, it is certain that the observer’s mind was greatly exercised
about this dark and oracular deliverance of the child. What
could he have meant? At length he bethought him that the
child was unable as yet to think of pure abstract time. To-morrow
had to be filled in with some concrete experience,
wherefore his wishing to define it as “to-morrow <em>morning</em>”
with the interesting experiences of the early hours of the day.
And if “to-morrow” means for his mind to-morrow’s experience,
he is quite logical in saying that it becomes to-day’s <em>experience</em>.
Whether the father has here caught the subtle thread
of childish thought may be doubted.<a id='r324' /><a href='#f324' class='c011'><sup>[324]</sup></a> Who among the wisest
of men could be sure of seizing the precise point which the
child makes such praiseworthy effort to render intelligible to us?</p>

<p class='c001'>It would appear as if C. were still rather muddled about
numbers. One day (end of third month) he was looking at
some big coloured beads on a necklace, and touching the
biggest he said to his mother: “These are six,” then some
smaller ones: “these five,” then some still smaller ones:
“these four,” and so on. He was apparently failing as yet to
distinguish number from that other mode of quantity which
we call magnitude.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>The use of the word “self” at this time showed that it had
reference mainly to the body, and apparently to the central
trunk. Thus one evening towards the end of the eleventh
month, after being put to bed, he was heard by his mother
crying out peevishly. Asked by her what was the matter he
answered, “I can’t get my hands out of the way of myself”;
which, being interpreted by his mother, was his way of saying
that he could not wriggle about and get into cool places (the
evening was a warm one) as he would like to do.</p>

<p class='c001'>As might be inferred from his essays in fictitious
narrative, he was getting quite an expert in the matter of
assertion. It was odd sometimes, observes the journal, to
hear the guarded manner in which he would proffer a statement.
Thus, on one occasion (beginning of twelfth month), he
reported to his father, who had been from home for some days,
that he had been behaving quite satisfactorily during his
absence, and then added cautiously, “I did not see mamma
punish me, anyhow”.</p>

<p class='c001'>During this year he followed up his questioning relentlessly,
often demanding the reasons of things, as children are wont
to do, in a sorely perplexing fashion. His interrogatory
embraced all manner of objects, both of sense-perception and
of thought. Thus he once asked his mother (seventh month)
how it was that he could put his hand through water and not
through the soap. A matter that came to puzzle him especially
just now was growth. Thus, when told by his father (tenth
month) that a little tree would grow big by-and-by, he asked,
"How is it that everything grows—flowers, trees, horses, and
people?" or, as he worded it a few days later, “How can
trees and sheep grow without anybody making them?” He
seems now (notes the father) to have given up his belief in the
growth of lifeless things. The inequalities of size among fully
grown things were also a puzzle to him. Thus, when just
four years old, he was much concerned to know why ponies
did not grow big like other horses.<a id='r325' /><a href='#f325' class='c011'><sup>[325]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The father must doubtless at this time have had his hands
full in satisfying the intellectual cravings of the child. But,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>happily, the small inquirer would sometimes come forward to
help out the explanation. One day (end of the year) his
father, when walking out with him, pointed to a big dray-horse
and said: “That is a strong horse”. On which the child
observed: “Ah! that horse can gallop fast”. He was then
told that heavy horses did not go fast. He looked puzzled for
a moment and then asked: “Do you mean can’t lift themselves
up?” “Had he,” asks the father, “noticed that when
weighted with thick clothes or other <em>impedimenta</em> he was less
springy, and so found his way, as is the manner of children,
from his own experience to explaining the apparent contradiction
of the strong and slow horse?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Other questionings were less amenable to purposes of
instruction. He would often get particularly thoughtful immediately
after going to bed, and put posers to his mother.
For example, one evening (tenth month) he asked in his slow,
earnest way, “Where was I a hundred years ago?” and then
more precisely, “Where was I before I was born?” These
are, as everybody knows, stock questions of childhood, and,
perhaps, are hardly worth recording. It is otherwise with a
curious poser which he set his father about the middle of the
last month: “When are all the days going to end, papa?” It
is a pity that the diary does not record the answer given to
the question. In lieu of this we have the customary pedantic
style of speculation about the “concept” of infinity with references
to Sir W. Hamilton and I don’t know what other
profound metaphysicians. The answer, if any was attempted,
does not appear to have been very satisfactory to Master C.,
for we read further on that more than three months after this
date he put the same question about all the days ending to his
mother.</p>

<p class='c001'>With this questioning about the causes of things there went
much assigning of reasons. By the end of the fourth month,
it is remarked, he was getting more accurate in his thinking,
substituting limited generalisations such as, “Some people do
this,” for the first hasty and sweeping ones. He appears,
further, to have grown much more ready in finding reasons,
bringing out “’cause” (because) on all manner of occasions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>much to his own satisfaction and hardly less to that of his
observant father. He continued, it is added, to display the
greatest ingenuity in finding reasons for his own often capricious-looking
behaviour, and especially in discovering excuses
whereby a veil of propriety might be thrown over actions which
he knew full well would, if left naked, have a naughty look.</p>

<p class='c001'>The tendency to give life to things observable in the last
year was less marked, but broke out now and again, as when
sitting one day (beginning of tenth month) on his chair on a
loose cushion and wriggling about as his manner was, he felt
the cushion slipping from under him and exclaimed: “Hullo!
I do b’lieve this cushion is alive. It moves itself.” About a
month after this the father set about testing the state of his
mind by asking him whether trees did not feel pain when they
were cut. This “leading question” was not to entrap Master
C., who answered with something of contempt in his tone:
“No, they only made of wood”. He was not so sure about
dead rabbits, however, saying first “yes” and then “no”.</p>

<p class='c001'>The intricate relations of things continued to trouble his
mind. His father chanced one day (end of eleventh month) to
remark at table that C. did not take his milk so nicely as he
used to do. C. pondered this awhile and then said: “It’s
funny that little babies behave better than big boys. They
don’t know so much as boys.” From which the father appears
to have inferred that children, like certain Greek philosophers,
are wont to identify virtue with cognition.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are not many brilliant strokes of childish rationality
to record during this year. It is worth noting, perhaps, that
when just seven months and one week of the year had passed,
he showed that he had found his own way to an axiomatic
truth familiar to students of geometry. He had been to the
circus the day before, where a gorgeous pantomimic spectacle
had greatly delighted him. He talked to his father of the
beautiful things, and among others, of “the fairies going up in
the air”. His father asked him how they were able to fly.
Whereupon with that good-natured readiness to enlighten the
darkness of grown-up people which makes the child the most
charming of instructors, he proceeded to explain in this wise:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>“They had wings, you know. Angels have wings like birds,
and fairies are like angels, and so you see fairies are like
birds.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The first development of reason in the child is apt to be
trying to parents and others, on account not only of the thick
hail-like pelting of questions to which it gives rise, but still
more, perhaps, of the circumstance that the young reasoner
will so readily turn his new instrument to a confusing criticism
of his elders. The daring interference of childish
dialectic with moral discipline in C.’s case has already been
touched on. Sometimes he would follow up a series of
questions so as to put his logical antagonist into a corner,
very much after the manner of the astute Socrates. Here is
an example of this highly inconvenient mode of dialectical
attack (middle of seventh month). He was at this time like
other children, much troubled about the killing of animals for
food. Again and again he would ask with something of
fierce impatience in his voice: “<em>Why</em> do people kill them?”
On one occasion he had plied his mother with these questionings.
He then contended that people who eat meat must like animals
to be killed. Finally, to clench the matter, he turned on his
mother and asked: “Do <em>you</em> like them to be killed?” Here
is another example of his persistent dialectical attack (end of
eleventh month). A small caterpillar happening to drop on
the shoulder of the father, the mother expressed the common dislike
for these creatures. C. was just now championing the whole
dumb creation against hard-hearted man, and he at once saw his
opportunity. ‘Why,’ he demanded in his peremptory catechising
tone, ‘don’t you like caterpillars?’ To which the mother, amused
perhaps with his grave argumentative manner, thought to
escape the attack by answering playfully: “Because they
make the butterflies”. But there was no room for jocosity in
C.’s mind when it was a matter of liking or disliking a living
creature. So he followed up his questioning with the true
Socratic irony, asking: “Why don’t you like butterflies?”
On this both the parents appear to have laughed; but he was
not to be upset, and ignoring the patent subterfuge of the
butterfly returned to the caterpillar. “Caterpillars,” he observed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>thoughtfully, “don’t make a noise.” He had doubtless
generalised that the pet aversions of his parents, more especially
his father, were dogs, cocks and other noise-producing
animals. Whether he returned to the subject of the caterpillar
is not stated. Perhaps his mother’s dislike for the wee soft
noiseless thing was to be added to the stock of unexplained
childish mysteries.</p>

<p class='c001'>Passing to manifestations of feeling, we have a curious
note on a new emotional expression. It seems that when a
suckling the child had got into the way of accompanying the
bliss of an ambrosial meal by soft caressing movements of the
fore-finger along the mother’s eyebrows. When three years
and ten months old he was sitting on his father’s lap in one of
his softer moods when he touched this parent’s eyebrows in the
same dainty caressing manner. The observer suspects that
we have here an example of a movement becoming an
emotional sign by association and analogy. At first associated
with the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ne plus ultra</i></span> of infantile happiness it came to
indicate the oncoming of any analogous state of feeling, and
especially of the luxurious mood of tenderness.</p>

<p class='c001'>Two or three curious examples of fear are recorded in this
chapter. In the second week of the fourth month he went with
his mother to the photographer’s to have his likeness taken.
When he reached the house he strongly objected, clung to his
mother and showed all the signs of a true fear. On entering
the room he told the photographer in his quiet authoritative
manner that he was not going to have his likeness taken. The
process, an instantaneous one, was accomplished, however,
without his knowing it. Next morning when asked by his
sister how he liked having his likeness taken, he answered
snappishly: “Haven’t had my likeness taken. Don’t you see I
can talk?” The father suspects that the child feared he would
be transformed by the black art of the camera into a speechless
photograph. It is curious that savages appear to show a similar
dread of the photographic camera. Thus, in a recent number
of the <cite>Graphic</cite> (November, 1893) there was a drawing of
Europeans and natives having their likeness taken in a camp
in South Africa. One native, terror-struck, is hiding behind a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>tree so as not to be taken. The text explains that the drawing
represents a real incident, and that the fear of the native came
from his belief that there is an evil spirit in the camera, and
adds that, on finding out that after all he was in the group,
the poor fellow instantly disappeared from the camp. Is there
not for all of us something uncanny in that black box turned
towards us bent on snatching from us the film or image of our
very self?</p>

<p class='c001'>The other instances of C.’s fear point to a like superstitious
frame of mind at this time. Thus in the last month he
happened one day to see some white linen swaying in the
breeze on a hill not far off. He took it for a light and was
afraid, saying it was a wolf. This was, we are told, his first
experience of ghosts. At the same date he showed fear when
passing through a wood with his father about nine o’clock on a
summer evening. Though his father was carrying him he
said he could not help being afraid of the dark. He fancied
there must be wolves in the dark. He afterwards informed his
father that his sister had told him so. The wolf appears at
this time (by a quaint confusion of zoology) to have been the
descendant of his old <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>bête noire</i></span>, the “bow-wow”. “Have
we,” writes the father, “a sort of parallel here to the superstition
of the were-wolf so familiar in folk-lore?”</p>

<p class='c001'>A new development of angry outburst is recorded. In the
third month, to the horror of his parents and the disgust of his
sister, he positively took to biting others, an action, it is needless
to say, which he could not have picked up from his highly
respectable human environment. Was this, asks the father,
with praiseworthy detachment of mind, an instinct, a survival
of primitive brute-like habit, and happily destined in the case
of a child born into a civilised society, like other instincts, as
pilfering, to be rudimentary and transient?</p>

<p class='c001'>As implied in the account of his much questioning, the
feeling which was most strongly marked and dominant during
this year was wonder. His father would surprise him sometimes
standing on the sofa and looking at an engraving of
Guido’s “Aurora” hanging on the wall above. The woman’s
figure in front, perfectly buoyant on the air, the horses and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>chariot firmly planted on the cloud, all this fascinated his
attention and filled him with delightful astonishment.</p>

<p class='c001'>With wonder there often went in these days sore perplexity
of spirit. The order of things was not only intricate and
difficult to take apart, it seemed positively wrong. That
animals should be beaten, slaughtered, eaten by his own kith
and kin, this, as already hinted, filled him with dismay. In
odd contrast to this, he would protest with equal warmth
against any ordinance which affected his own comfort. Thus,
having on one occasion (middle of seventh month) taken a
lively interest in the manufacture of jellies, custards, and other
dainties, and having learned the next day that they had been
disposed of by a company of guests, he asked his mother querulously
why she had “wisitors,” and then added in a comical
tone of self-compassion, “Didn’t the ‘wisitors’ know you had
a little boy?” “It is odd to note,” writes the father, “how a
humane concern for the lower creation coexisted with utter
indifference to the duties of hospitality. Perhaps, however,”
he adds, succumbing to paternal weakness, and saying the
best he can for his boy, “there was no real contradiction here.
The compassionateness of childhood goes forth to weak,
defenceless things, and to C.’s mind the ‘wisitors’ may very
likely have appeared as over-fed, greedy monsters who robbed
poor children of their small perquisites.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The wondering impulse of the child assumed now and
again a quasi-religious form in speculations about death and
heaven. Early in the year he had lost his grandpapa by
sudden death, and the event set his thoughts in this direction.
In the ninth month his mother read him Wordsworth’s well-known
story, “Lucy Gray”. He was much saddened by
the account of Lucy’s death. On hearing the line “In heaven
we all shall meet,” he began questioning his mother about
heaven. She gave him the popular description of heaven, but
apparently in a way that left him uncertain as to whether she
believed what she said. Whereupon he exclaimed: ‘We <em>shall</em>
meet,’ and then after a moment’s pause, as though not quite
certain, added, ‘shan’t we?’ Five weeks later, when driving
in the country with his mother on a lovely May day, he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>in his happiest mood, looking at the flowers in the fields and
hedgerows, and suddenly exclaimed: “I shall never die!”
The question of immortality (observes the father) had thus
early begun to wring the child’s soul.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are, I regret to say, in this chapter, hardly any remarks
about the development of the child’s will and moral
character. The father appears to have been disproportionately
interested in the boy’s intellectual advancement. The reader
is left to hope that Master C. was growing a more orderly and
law-abiding child than the incident of the biting would suggest.
The one remark which can be brought under this head refers
to the growth of practical intelligence in applying rules to
action. C. had been told it was well to keep nice things to the
end, and he proceeded to work out the consequences of the
rule in an amusing fashion. Thus we read (end of eleventh
month) that he would take all the currants out of his cake and
stick them round the corner of his plate so as to eat them last.
A still more amusing instance of the same thing occurred about
the same date. On putting him to bed one evening his mother
noticed that he carefully sought out the middle of the bed, saying
to himself, “I’ll keep these last”. Questioned by her as
to what he meant by ‘these,’ he explained, “These nice cool
places at the edge of the bed”. “Children,” remarks the
chronicler, “do not drop their originality even when they
make a show of following our lead. Obedience would be far
more tedious than it is but for the occasional opportunities of a
play of inventive fancy in the application of a rule to new and
out-of-the-way cases.”</p>

<h3 class='c017'><i>Fifth Year.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>With the fifth year we enter upon a new phase of the diary.
The father appears now to have finally abandoned the transparent
pretence of a methodical record of progress, and he
limits himself to a fuller account of a few selected incidents.
Very noticeable is the introduction of something like prolonged
dialogue between the child and one of his parents.</p>

<p class='c001'>The boy continued to take a lively interest in objects and
to note them with care. Here is an illustration of his attention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>to natural phenomena. He was walking out (end of fifth
month) with his father on their favourite Heath towards sunset,
when he asked: “What are these pretty things I see after
looking at the sun? When I move my eyes they begin to
move about.” The father said he might call them fairy suns.
He then wanted to know whether they were real. He said:
“When they seem to be on the path they disappear when I go
up to them”. Later on he began to romance about the
spectral discs that he saw after looking at a red sun, calling
them fire balloons and saying that there was a fairy in each
one of them.<a id='r326' /><a href='#f326' class='c011'><sup>[326]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>A quaint example of his attention to the form of objects,
as well as of his odd childish mode of thought, comes out in
a talk with his mother (end of seventh month). She had been
reading to him from <cite>Alice in Wonderland</cite>, where the caterpillar
tells Alice that one side of a mushroom would make her grow
taller, and one side shorter, which set Alice wondering what the
side of a mushroom could be. C. could not sympathise with
Alice’s perplexity, and said to his mother: “Why, a mushroom
is all ends and sides. Wherever you stand it’s an end or a
side.” The father thinks he sees here a dim apprehension of
the idea that a circle is formed by an infinite number of straight
lines, but he is possibly reading too much into the boy’s thought.</p>

<p class='c001'>His observation of colour continued. One day (end of
seventh month) he was overheard by his father saying to himself
(without any suggestion from another) that a particular
colour “came next” to another. His father thereupon questioned
him and elicited that orange came next to red. Asked
‘What else?’ he answered yellow. Dark brown came next to
black, a lighter brown to red, purple next to blue, pink to red,
and so forth. Asked what green came next to, he answered:
“I don’t know”; from which it would appear that he had
pretty clearly observed the affinities of colours.</p>

<p class='c001'>He showed himself observant of people’s ways too. Here
is a funny example of his attention to his sister’s habits of
speech. One evening (end of sixth month) when his sister was
out at a party he had a cracker which he wished to give her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>“as a surprise”. So he told his mother to put it under the
table, and added: “When E. comes in, and after she says,
‘Well! how’ve you been getting on?’ then you must say:
‘Look under the table’”.</p>

<p class='c001'>His memory, as the foregoing incident may show, was
growing tenacious and exact. This exactitude showed itself in
almost a pedantic fashion with respect to words. Here is a
funny example (end of sixth month). He had a new story-book,
<cite>The Princess Nobody</cite>, illustrated by R. Doyle. His
mother had read it to him about four or five times during the
three weeks he had possessed it. One Sunday evening his
father read it to him as a treat. In one place the story runs:
“One day when the king had been counting out his money all
day,” which the father carelessly read as “counting out all
his money”. The child at once pulled up and corrected his
sire, saying, “No, papa, ’tis ‘counting out all the day his
money’”. He had remembered the ideas and the words though
not the precise order. The jealous regard of the child for the
text of his sacred books in the face of would-be mutilators is
one of those traits which, while perfectly childish, have a
quaint old-fashioned look.</p>

<p class='c001'>The dreamy worship of fairies passed into a new and even
more blissful phase this year. Before the close of the third
month C. was actually brought into contact with one of these
dainty white-clad beings. The memorable occasion was a
girl’s costume ball, to which he was taken as a spectator.
Among the younger girls present was one dressed as a fairy,
in short white gauze, golden crown, and the rest. C. was at
first dazed by the magnificence of the assembly and shrank
back shyly to his mother’s side; but after this white sylph had
been pointed out to him as a fairy, and when she came up to
him and spoke to him, he was transported with delight.
Hitherto the fairy had never been nearer to him than on a
circus stage: now he had one close to him and actually talked
with her! He firmly believed in the supernatural character of
this small person, and on his return home proceeded to tell
cook with radiant face how he had seen a live fairy and spoken
to her. He added that his sister had never spoken to one.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>This last might easily look like a touch of malicious ‘crowing’:
yet the father appears to think that the boy meant only to
deepen the mystery of the revelation by pointing out that it
was without precedent.</p>

<p class='c001'>The weaving of fairy legend now went on vigorously.
Sometimes when out on a walk and observing a scene he
would suddenly drop into his dream-mood and spin a pretty
romance. This happened one Sunday in winter (beginning of
seventh month), as he stood and watched the skaters on a
pond. He said his fairies could skate, and he talked more
particularly of his favourite Pinkbill, whom, he said, he
now saw skating, though nobody else was privileged to see
her, and who loved to skate at night on tiny pools which were
quite big for her. “Delightful days (writes the father, who
is rather apt to gush in these later chapters), when one holds
a wondrous world of beauty in one’s own breast, safe from all
prying eyes, to be whispered of perhaps to one’s dearest, but
never to be shown.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The full enjoyment of this supernal world was during sleep.
C. often spoke of his lovely dreams. One morning (middle of
fourth month) when still in bed, he engaged his mother in the
following talk: C. “Do you have beautiful dreams, mamma?”
Mother. “No, dear, I don’t dream much.” C. “Oh, if you
want to dream you must hide your head in the pillow and shut
your eyes tight.” Mother. “Is dreaming as good as hearing
stories?” C. “Oh, yes, I should think so. One gets to know
about all sorts of things one didn’t know anything about
before.” Dreams (writes the father) came to him like his fire-balloons
by shutting his eyes tight, and perhaps his story-books
were the real suns of which his dreams were the ‘after-images’.</p>

<p class='c001'>As the use of the grown-up and high-bred vocable "one"—the
first instance observed, by-the-bye,—suggests, C. was
making rapid strides in the use of language. By the middle
of the year, we are told, he could articulate all sounds including
the initial <em>y</em> and <em>th</em> when he tried to do so. He gave to the <em>a</em>
sound an unusual degree of broadness, a fact which lent to his
speech a comical air of learned superiority. This was of course
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>especially the case when, as still happened, he would slip into
such solecisms as ‘I were’ and ‘Weren’t I?’ He would still
use some quaint original expressions. It may interest the
philologist to know that he quite spontaneously got into the
way of using ‘spend’ for ‘cost,’ as in asking one day (beginning
of third month), on seeing a frill in a shop window:
‘How much does this frill spend?’ and also of making ‘learn’
do duty for ‘teach,’ as when (end of tenth month) he asked
his mother, pointing to a globe: “When are you going to
learn me that ball?”</p>

<p class='c001'>He continued quite seriously and with no thought of producing
an effect to frame new words more or less after the
analogy of those in use. Thus one day (middle of third month)
he surprised his parents by bringing out the verb ‘fireworking’
in reference to the coming festivities of the fifth of November.
Sometimes, too, he would amuse them by trotting out
some ‘grown-up’ phrase which he generally used with clear
insight, though now and again he would miss the precise shade
of meaning. Thus it happened (about middle of fifth month)
that he had been taking tea at the house of some girl friends,
and on his return his mother questioned him about his doings,
and in particular what his host had said to him. C. pondered
for a moment and then said: “Oh! nothing surprising”.</p>

<p class='c001'>This progress in the use of language indicated a higher
power of mental abstraction. This was seen among other
ways in the attainment of much clearer ideas about number.
In the second month of the year he was able, we are told, to
define the relations of the simpler numbers, saying that four
was one less than five, and so on. That he had his own way
of counting is evident from the following story, which dates
from the middle of the same month. When walking with his
mother on the Heath he found four crab apples. He observed to
her: “How nice it would be, mamma, if I could find two
more!” His mother replied: “Yes. How many would you
have then, C.?” To this C. responded in his grave business-like
tone: “Wait a minute,” then got down on his knees, put
the four apples in a row, and then proceeded to the mysterious
ceremony of counting. He began by saying ‘one, two’ to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>himself, then on reaching the “three” he pointed to the first
of the row, using the apples to help him in adding the four
last digits. He appears, says the father, to have imagined or
‘visualised’ the first two units, and then used the visible
objects for the rest of the operation—not a bad way, one would
say, of turning the apples to this simple arithmetical use.</p>

<p class='c001'>That he visualised distinctly when counting is illustrated
by another incident dating three weeks later. His mother,
as was her wont, was seeing him into bed. Before
climbing on to the bed he put on the coverlid a number of
small toy treasures. When tucked up he opened up the following
dialogue. C. “Put my toys in the drawer, mamma.”
M. “I have done it, dear.” C. “How many were there?”
M. ‘Three.’ C. “Oh no, there were four.” M. “Are you
sure, dear? What were they?” C., after sitting up and
pointing successively to imaginary objects on the coverlid:
"One, two, three, four,—two dollies, a tin soldier, and a
shell".</p>

<p class='c001'>His interest in physical phenomena continued to manifest
itself in questionings. He would spring his problems in physics
on his patient parents at the most unexpected moments.
For instance, when sitting at table one day (end of first month)
he observed quite suddenly, and in no discoverable connexion
with what had been happening before: “There’s one thing
I <em>can’t</em> imagine. How is it, papa, that when we put our hand
into the water we don’t make a hole in it?” It would be
curious to know how the father dealt with this hydrostatic
problem.</p>

<p class='c001'>The other inquiries recorded about this time have, oddly
enough, to do with water. It looks as if water were dividing
with number just now the activity of his brain. Thus he
asked one day when staying at the sea-side (middle of second
month): “How does all the water come into the world?”
His mind was also greatly exercised about the hydrostatic
puzzle of things sinking and swimming (floating).</p>

<p class='c001'>There are hardly any examples of a reasoning process this
year. One of these, however, is perhaps characteristic enough to
deserve reproduction. One day (middle of fourth month) when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>his mind was running on the great problems of counting, his
sister happened to speak about a large number of chestnuts
(over 200). This excited C.’s imagination, and he exclaimed:
“Why, even Goliath couldn’t count them”. The idea that
mere bulk should measure intellectual capacity was delicious,
and C.’s remark was no doubt received with a peal of laughter
to which the bewildered little inquirer into the mysteries of things
must by this time have been getting hardened. And yet, writes
the apologetic father, C.’s reasoning was not so utterly silly as
it looks, for in his daily measurement of his own faculties with
those of others what had impressed him most deeply was
that knowledge is the prerogative of big folk.</p>

<p class='c001'>With respect to C.’s emotional development during this
year, I am pleased to be able to record a diminution in the
outbursts of angry passion. There seems to have been no
more biting, and altogether he was growing less homicidal and
more human. It is only to be expected that the father should set
down these paroxysms of rage to temporary physical conditions.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among feelings which were still strong and frequently
manifested was fear. He had no fear of the dark, and did
not in the least mind being left alone when put to bed. But
he was weakly timid in relation to other things, <i>e.g.</i>, the
tepid morning bath, from which he shrank as from a horror.
His bravery was as yet an infinitesimal quantity, as we may
see from the following anecdote. His mother was one day
(end of fourth month) talking to him about the self-denying
bravery of captains of ships when shipwrecked. She asked
him whether he would not like to be brave too, adding
for his encouragement that many timid little boys like him had
grown up to be brave men. Upon this I regret to say that
C. asked sceptically, “Do they?” and then added, with a little
impatient wriggle of his body, “I am going to be a painter,
and painters don’t need to be brave”. The mother pursued
the subject saying: “But if when you are big we all go to
sea and get shipwrecked, wouldn’t you wish mamma and E.
to get into the boat before you?” C. managed to parry even
this home-drive, answering: “Oh, yes, but I should get in the
very minute after you”.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>A noticeable change occurred during this period in what
the Germans call “self-feeling”. A consciousness of growing
power gave a certain feeling of dignity and even of superiority
which often betrayed itself in his words and actions. Although,
so far as I can gather, a pretty boy, and a good deal admired
for his golden hair, he does not seem to have set much store
by his good looks. One day (towards end of sixth month) a
grown-up cousin remarked at table that he had had his hair
cut: whereupon ensued this talk. Mother (to cousin). “It
looks better now that it is cut.” C. “Oh, no, it was prettier
before.” Cousin. “Oh, you think you’ve got pretty hair.”
C. (unhesitatingly). “Oh, yes.” Cousin. “Who told you your
hair was pretty?” C. “Mamma.” “All this,” writes the
father, “was said very quietly, and without the least appearance
of vanity. He might have been talking about the hair of
another person, or of a head in one of his pictures. His interest
here seemed to be much more in correcting his mother and
bringing her into consistency with former statements than in
laying claim to prettiness.”</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, the child does certainly appear to have
plumed himself a good deal on his intellectual possessions. It
is to be noted that about this time he grew unpleasantly
assertive and controversial. He would even sometimes stick
to his own view of things when contradicted by his parents.
He prided himself more particularly on being “sensible,”
as he called it. His eagerness to be thought so may be
illustrated by the following incident. He and his mother had
been reading a story in which a little girl speaks of her mother
as the best mother in the world. Whereupon in a weak
moment his mother asked him, “Do you think your mother
the best in the world, dear?” To this C. replied, “Well, I
think you are good, but not <em>the best in the world</em>. That would
not be sensible, would it, mamma?” We are not told how
this Cordelia-like moderation was received.</p>

<p class='c001'>To many people, mothers especially, there might well
seem to be a touch of the prig in this exact weighing of words
when it was a question only of the exaggeration of love. I regret
to say that about this same time a tendency to priggishness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>did certainly show itself in a critical air of superiority towards
girls of his own age. When about four years eight
months he was sent to stay for a few days at the house of a
lady friend where there was a girl about his own age, who
seems to have been a lively mischievous young person,
delighting in ‘drawing’ her grave boy comrade. On his return
home he entertained his mother by expressing his feeling
respecting his new companion. He said: “I don’t like E.’s
looks. She looks naughty. Her cheeks look naughty” (and
he puffed out his own cheeks by way of illustration). He
added: “She looks naughty about here,” pointing to his
forehead just above the eyes. He then proceeded to describe
the measures he had taken for correcting her naughtiness.</p>

<p class='c001'>“One day,” he said, “when she was naughty, I told her
about dynamite men, and she was naughty after that. And
then I told her about the dynamite men being put in prison,
and she was naughty even then.” On this his mother interposed:
“Why ever did you talk about dynamite men, dear?”
C. “Because I thought it would make her better. Perhaps if I
could have told her what sort of a place a prison was that
would have made her better. But I didn’t know.” Then after
a pause: “What do they put people in prison for, mamma?”</p>

<p class='c001'>M. “For stealing, hurting other people, and telling
stories.”</p>

<p class='c001'>C. (abruptly). “Oh, E. tells a lot of stories.”</p>

<p class='c001'>M. “Oh no, E. doesn’t tell stories.”</p>

<p class='c001'>C. “Yes, she does. When I say yes she says no, and I
know that I am right.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He talked of this same experience of feminine frailty to
others, remarking to one of his lady friends that E. had not
said a sensible thing all the week he was staying with her.
He also attacked his father on the subject, and after illustrating
her odd way of contradicting others, he observed: “She’s are
never as sensible as he’s, I suppose, are they, papa? especially
if a boy is older”.</p>

<p class='c001'>The father asked him if he had shown his displeasure to
his girl playmate, to which he replied: “I didn’t show my
angriness;” and after a pause: “I’d better not show how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>angry I can be, I’m too strong and too big, ain’t I?” As a
matter of fact he had once, at least, been so ungallant as to
strike his companion on her nose with one of his toys, selecting
this objective for his attack apparently for no other reason
than that it was already disfigured by a scratch. He wound
up this disquisition on E.’s shortcomings by an attempt at a
magnanimous allowance for her weakness: “I b’lieve she
tries not to say these things because she knows they will tease
me, but I think she can’t help it;” and he repeated this as if to
emphasise the point.</p>

<p class='c001'>Even our much-biassed chronicler is obliged to own that
all this is a lamentable exhibition of boyish swagger, and
particularly out of place in one born in these enlightened days,
when, as we all know, ‘she’s’ are as good as ‘he’s,’ if not a
great deal better. The only palliation of the unpleasant picture
of coxcombry which he offers is the information that a year
or too later C.’s views about girls were profoundly modified
when he found himself in a school where a girl of his own age
could beat him at certain things of the mind.</p>

<p class='c001'>The growing vigour of his self-consciousness was shown
in other ways too. He was much hurt by anything which
seemed to him an invasion of his liberty. About the end
of the sixth month, we read, he had got into ‘finicking’
ways of taking his food. Thus he conceived a strong dislike
for the ‘cream’ on his boiled milk. If anybody attempted to
cross him in these faddish ways he would be greatly offended.
It looks as if he were at this time getting a keen sense of
private rights, any interference with which he regarded as an
offence.</p>

<p class='c001'>The story about what he would do if his family were ship-wrecked
suggests that self-sacrifice was as yet not a strong
element in the boy’s moral constitution. Egoism, it might
well seem, was still the foundation of his character. This
egoism would peep out now and again in his talk. One day
(middle of eighth month) when the family was lodging in a
cottage his mother had reason to scold him for walking on the
flower-beds in the cottage garden. Whereupon he answered:
“It isn’t your garden, it’s Mr. G.’s”. To this the mother
<span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>observed: “I know, dear, but I have to be all the more particular
because it is not mine”; which observation drew forth
the following: “I should think Mr. G. would be all the more
particular because it is his”. It was evident, writes the father,
from this somewhat cynical observation that caring for things
and resenting any injury to them seemed to C. to devolve on
the owner and on nobody else.</p>

<p class='c001'>He himself certainly did repel any encroachment on his
rights. Here is an amusing illustration. One day (the end
of seventh month) he was playing on the Heath under
the eye of his mother. He had put on one of the seats a lot
of grass and sand as fodder for his wooden horse. While he
went away for a minute a strange nurse and children arrived,
making a perfectly legitimate use of the bench by seating
themselves on it, and in order to get room brushing away the
precious result of his foraging expedition. On coming back
and seeing what had happened he turned to his mother and
swelling with indignation exclaimed loudly: “What do you
mean by it, letting these children move away my things?”
Of course this was intended to intimidate the real culprits, the
children. Finding that they were not abashed at this, but on
the contrary were looking at one another with a look of high-bred
astonishment, he turned to them and shouted: “What do you
mean by it?” This outburst, observes the father, showed a
preternatural heat of indignation, for in general he was very
distant and reserved towards strange children.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet C. was very far from being wholly absorbed in himself
and his own interests. It cannot be said indeed that self
monopolised the intensest of his feelings, for he felt just as
strongly for others too. There was, we are told, a marked
development of sympathy during this year. His sister was
now away from home at school, and the absence seems to have
drawn out kindly feeling. So that when, on one occasion
(middle of seventh month), his father and aunt were going to
visit her, and to take her to the Crystal Palace, though he
wanted dreadfully to go himself, he made a great effort, and in
answer to his father’s question, what message he had for his
sister, answered a little tremulously, “Give her my love,” and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_475'>475</span>then, waxing more valiant, added, “I hope she will enjoy
herself at Crystal Palace”.</p>

<p class='c001'>Some months later (end of ninth month), he proved himself
considerate for his father, whose repugnance to noises
has already been alluded to. A man had come to repair a
window and his father had been forced to stop his work and to
go out. On his return C. met him in the garden and asked him
loudly, evidently so that the man might hear, “Does that man
disturb you, papa?” He had previously talked to his mother
in an indignant way about the noises which disturbed his
father. About a fortnight after this, on hearing some children
make an uproar in the passage, he asked indignantly, “What
are those children about, making papa not do his work?” “He
was at this time,” writes the father, “transferring some of that
chivalrous protection which he first bestowed on animals to
his own kith and kin. He became to me just at this time
something of a guardian angel.”</p>

<p class='c001'>His compassion for the lower creation had meanwhile by
no means lessened. Here is a story which shows how the
killing of animals by human hands still tortured his young
heart. One day (towards end of fourth month) he was looking
at his beloved picture-book of animals. <em>Apropos</em> of a picture
of some seals he began a talk with his mother in the usual
way by asking her a question.</p>

<p class='c001'>C. “What are seals killed for, mamma?”</p>

<p class='c001'>M. “For the sake of their skins and oil.”</p>

<p class='c001'>C. (turning to a picture of a stag). “Why do they kill the
stags? They don’t want <em>their</em> skins, do they?”</p>

<p class='c001'>M. “No, they kill them because they like to chase them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>C. “Why don’t policemen stop them?”</p>

<p class='c001'>M. “They can’t do that, because people are allowed to kill
them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>C. (loudly and passionately). “Allowed, allowed? People
are not allowed to take other people and kill them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>M. “People think there is a difference between killing men
and killing animals.”</p>

<p class='c001'>C. was not to be pacified this way. He looked woe-begone
and said to his mother piteously, “You don’t understand me”.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>He added that he would tell his friend the Heath-keeper about
these things.</p>

<p class='c001'>The father observes on this: “There was something almost
heart-breaking in that cry ‘You don’t understand me’. How
can we, with minds blinded by our conventional habits and
prejudices, hope to catch the subtle and divine light which is
reflected from the untarnished mirror of a child’s mind?” Somehow,
the father’s sentimental comments seem less out of place
here. But already the boy’s wrestlings of spirit with the
dreadful ‘must,’ which turns men into killers, were proving too
much for his young strength. He was learning, sullenly
enough, to adjust his eye to the inevitable realities. This
accommodation of thought to stern necessity was illustrated by
an incident which occurred at the end of the fourth month.
He had had some leaden soldiers given him at Christmas.
Some time after this he had been observed to break off their
guns. His mother now asked him why he had broken them
off. He replied: “Oh! that was when I didn’t know what
soldiers were for, when I thought they were just naughty men
who liked to kill people”. On his mother then asking him
what he now thought soldiers were for, he explained: “Oh!
when some people want to do harm to some <em>other</em> people, then
those other people must send their soldiers to fight them, to
stop them from doing harm”.</p>

<p class='c001'>One moral quality had, it seems, always been distinctly
marked in C., <i>viz.</i>, a scrupulous regard for truth. His father
believes the child had never knowingly made a false statement,
save playfully, when throwing for a moment the reins on the
neck of fancy and allowing it to come dangerously near the
confines of truth. This scrupulosity the father connects,
reasonably enough, with certain intellectual qualities, as close
observation and accurate description of what was observed.
Sometimes this scrupulous veracity would display itself in
a quaint form. One morning (end of tenth month) C. was
obstinate and would not say his lesson to his mother, so that
she had to threaten him with forfeiture of his toys till the
lesson was got through. On this C. said rebelliously: “Very
well, I won’t say them”. His mother then talked to him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_477'>477</span>about his naughtiness. He grew very unhappy, and said
sobbing and looking the very picture of misery: “It’s a good
deal worse to break my promise than not to say my lesson”.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another incident of about the same date throws a curious
light on the quality of his moral feeling at this period. He had
been out one afternoon in the garden with a girl companion of
about his own age, and the two little imps between them had
managed to strip that unpretending garden of its spring glory,
to wit, about twenty buds of peonies. The sacrilege betrayed
itself in C.’s red-dyed fingers. A condign chastisement was
administered by the mother, and the culprit was sent to bed
immediately after tea in the hope that solitude might bring
reflexion and remorse. In order to ensure so desirable a
result the mother before leaving him in bed enlarged on the
heinousness of the offence. At last he began to get downright
miserable, and the mother, expectant of a confession of guilt,
overheard him say to himself: “I’m <em>so</em> sorry I picked the
flowers. I didn’t have half enough tea.” The next day,
referring to his mischievous act, his mother happened to say:
“You were not sorry for it at the time”. Whereupon he
burst out in a contemptuous tone: “Eh! you didn’t suppose I
was sorry at the time? I liked doing it.” “Shocking enough,
no doubt,” writes the father on this in his characteristic manner,
“yet may we not see in this defiant avowal of enjoyment in
wrong-doing the germ of a true remorse, which in its essence
is the resolute confronting of the lower by the higher self?”</p>

<p class='c001'>His mind was still occupied about the mysteries of God,
death, and heaven. Following the example of his sister he
would occasionally on going to bed quite spontaneously say
his prayers. One evening at the end of the eleventh month,
having knelt down and muttered over some words, he asked
his mother whether she had heard him. She said no, and he
remarked that he had not wished her to hear. On her asking
why not, he rejoined: “If anybody hears what I say perhaps
God won’t listen to me,” which seems to suggest that talking to
God was to him something particularly confidential, what he
himself once described as telling another a “private secret”.<a id='r327' /><a href='#f327' class='c011'><sup>[327]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_478'>478</span>When his mother asked him what he had been praying for he
said it was for a fine day on his birthday. He thought much
of God as the maker of things, and wondered. One day
(middle of tenth month) he asked how God made us and “put
flesh on us,” and made “what is inside us”. He then proceeded
to invent a little theory of creation. “I s’pose he made stone
men and iron men first, and then made real men.” “This
myth,” writes the father, “might readily suggest that the
child had been hearing about the stone and the iron age, and
about sculptors first modelling their statues in another material.
It seems probable, however, that it was invented by a purely
childish thought as a way of clearing up the mystery of the
living thinking man.” There is subsequent evidence that
his theory did not fully satisfy him. In the eleventh month he
continued to ask how God made things, and wanted to know
whether ‘preachers’ could resolve his difficulty. (His sister
appears about this time to have had the common childish
awe for the clergy.) On learning from his mother that
even these well-informed persons might not be able to satisfy
all his questions, he observed: “Well, anyhow, if we go to
heaven when we die we shall know,” and added after a pause,
“and if we don’t it doesn’t much matter”. “From this,”
writes the father, “it seems fully clear that the child was
beginning to adjust his mind to the fact of mystery, to the
existence of an impenetrable region of the unknown.”</p>

<p class='c001'>C.’s deepest interest just now in religious matters grew out
of the feelings awakened by the thought of death. In the early
part of the year he plied his mother with questions about death
and burial. He was manifestly troubled about the prospect of
being put under ground. One night (end of third month) when
his mother was seeing him to bed, he said: “Don’t put earth
on my face when I am buried”. The touch of the bed-clothes
on his face had no doubt suggested the stifling effect of the
earth. About the same date he remarked in his characteristic
abrupt manner, after musing for some time: “Mamma, perhaps
the weather will be <em>very</em>, <em>very</em> fine, much finer than we have
ever seen, when we are not there”. The mother was not unnaturally
puzzled by this dark utterance and asked him what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>he meant. He replied: “I mean when we are buried, and then
we shall be very sorry”. “Who can tell,” writes the father,
“what this fancy of lying under the ground, yet catching the
whispering of the most delicious of summer breezes, and the far-off
touch of the gladdest of sunbeams, and the faint scent of
the sweetest of flowers, may have meant for the wee dreamy
sensitive creature?”</p>

<p class='c001'>The following dialogue between C. and his mother at the
beginning of the fourth month may further illustrate his feeling
about this subject.</p>

<p class='c001'>C. “Why must people die, mamma?”</p>

<p class='c001'>M. “They get worn out, and so can’t live always, just as
the flowers and leaves fade and die.”</p>

<p class='c001'>C. “Well, but why can’t they come to life again just like
the flowers?”</p>

<p class='c001'>M. “The same flowers don’t come to life again, dear.”</p>

<p class='c001'>C. “Well, the little seed out of the flower drops into the
earth and springs up again into a flower. Why can’t people
do like that?”</p>

<p class='c001'>M. “Most people get very tired and want to sleep for
ever.”</p>

<p class='c001'>C. “Oh! <em>I</em> shan’t want to sleep for ever, and when I am
buried I shall try to wake up again; and there won’t be any
earth on my eyes, will there, mamma?”</p>

<p class='c001'>The difficulty of coupling the fact of burial with after-existence
in heaven then began to trouble him. One day
(middle of eighth month) he and his mother were passing a
churchyard. He looked intently at the gravestones and asked:
“Mamma, it’s only the naughty people who are buried, isn’t
it?” Being asked why he thought so he continued: “Because
auntie said all the good people went to heaven”. On his
mother telling him that all people are buried he said: “Oh,
then heaven must be under the ground, or they couldn’t get
there”. Another way by which he tried to surmount the difficulty
was by supposing that God would have to come up through
the ground to take us to heaven. He clung tenaciously to the
idea of heaven as an escape from the horror of death. That
the hope of heaven was the core of his religious belief is seen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>in the following little talk between him and his mother and
sister one evening at the end of the first month.</p>

<p class='c001'>C. “Does God ever die?”</p>

<p class='c001'>E. (the sister). “No, dear, and when we die God will take
us to live with him in heaven.”</p>

<p class='c001'>C. (to mother). “Will he, mamma?”</p>

<p class='c001'>M. “I hope so, dear.”</p>

<p class='c001'>C. “Well, what is God good for if he won’t take us to
heaven when we die?”<a id='r328' /><a href='#f328' class='c011'><sup>[328]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c017'><i>Sixth Year.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>The sixth year, the last with which the diary attempts
to deal, is very meagrely represented. The observation was
plainly becoming intermittent and lax. I have, however,
thought it worth while to complete this sketch of a child’s
mental development by a reference to this fragmentary
chapter.</p>

<p class='c001'>The child continued to be observant of the forms of things.
He began to attend the Kindergarten at the beginning of this
year, and this probably served to develop his visual observation.
We have, however, no very striking illustrations of his
perceptual powers. It might interest the naturalist to know
that he compared the head of Mr. Darwin, which he saw in a
photograph, to that of an elephant, and being asked why he
thought them like one another, answered: “Because it is so
far from the top of the head to the ear”. Perhaps admirers of
our great naturalist may be ready to pardon the likening of their
hero’s head to that of one of the most intelligent of the large
animal family which he showed to be our kinsfolk.</p>

<p class='c001'>Another remark of his at about the same date seems to
show that he still entertained a particularly gross form of the
animistic conception that things are double, and that there is a
second filmy body within the solid tangible one. He was looking
at the pictures in Darwin’s <cite>Descent of Man</cite>, and came
on some drawings of the human embryo. His mother asked
him what they looked like, and he replied: “Why, like the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_481'>481</span>inside of persons of course”.  Asked to explain this he pointed
to the head, the eye, the stomach, and so forth.</p>

<p class='c001'>He spontaneously began to talk (middle of eighth month)
about opposition of colours. He was looking at his coloured
soldiers and talking to himself in this wise: “Which colour
is most opposite colour to blue?” He said that red was its
opposite, not yellow as suggested by his father, in which
opinion he probably has a good many older people on his side.
He also observed to his father at the same date: “I tell you,
papa, what two colours are very like one another, blue and
green”. The father remarks, however, that he was now
mixing pigments and using them, and that the knowledge so
gained probably made him bring blue and green nearer to one
another than he used to do.</p>

<p class='c001'>An opportunity of testing his memory occurred at the
beginning of the sixth month. He met a gentleman who had
been kind to him during that memorable visit to the sea-side
village D—— just three and a half years before, and whom he
had not seen since. His father asked the child whether he
knew Mr. S. He looked at him steadily, and answered yes.
Asked where he had seen him, he answered: "Down at
——". He had forgotten the name of the place. On his
father further asking him what he remembered about him he
said: “He made me boats and sailed them in a pool”. This
was quite correct. So far as the father can say the fact had
not been spoken of to him since the time. If this is so, it
seems worth recording that a child of five and a half should
recall such distinct impressions of what had occurred when he
was only just two.</p>

<p class='c001'>Fancy, the old frisky, wonder-working fancy, was now
getting less active. At least, we meet this year with none of
the pretty fairy-myths of earlier years. So far as the journal
tells us, it was only in sleep that C. entered the delightful
region of wonderland. Here is a quaint dream of his (end of
fifth month). It was Christmas time, and he had been seeing
a huge prize-ox, a shaggy Highland fellow with big head and
curled horns. He had taken a violent fancy to it and wanted
his father to draw it for him. A morning or two afterwards he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_482'>482</span>told his father that he had had a funny dream. Both his father
and his mother were turned into oxen, and it was a “very nice
dream”.</p>

<p class='c001'>For the rest, the brain of our little Kindergärtner was being
engrossed with the business of getting knowledge, and, as a
result of this fancy, was being taken in hand by sober understanding
and drilled to the useful and necessary task of
discovering truth.</p>

<p class='c001'>We get one or two pretty glimpses of the boy trundling
his hoop beside his father in a late evening walk and now and
again stopping to ask questions. Here is one (end of third
month): They were walking home together across the sands
at Hunstanton at the rosy sun-set hour. C. was much impressed
and began asking his father how far off the sun was.
On finding out that the clouds were not a hard substance but
could be passed through, he wanted to know what was on the
other side. “Is it another world, papa, like this?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Shortly after this date he was talking about the size of the sun,
when he remarked: “I s’pose the sun’s big enough to put on the
world and make see-saw”. He seemed to think of the sun as a
disc, and imagined that it might be balanced on the earth-globe.</p>

<p class='c001'>What with home instruction and the ‘lessons’ at the
Kindergarten his little brain was being confronted with quite a
multitude of new problems. It was interesting, remarks the
father, to note how he would try to piece together the various
scraps of knowledge he thus gathered. For instance, we find
him in the ninth month trying hard to make something out of
the motley presentations of the ‘world’ which he had got from
classical myths as known through the <cite>Tanglewood Tales</cite> and
from his elementary geography lessons. He asked whether
Atlas could stand in the middle of the sea and not be drowned.
On his father’s trying to evade this awkward question, the boy
inquired whether the sea came half way up the world. Asked
to explain what he meant, he continued: “You know the shore
gets lower and lower or else the sea would not go out; and
out in the middle it goes down very deep. Now, where the
sea comes in, is that half way up the world?” One would like
to know how the father met this dark inquiry.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_483'>483</span>He would sometimes apply his newly-gained knowledge in
an odd fashion. One day (middle of ninth month), he observed
that his porridge was hottest in the middle, and remarked:
“That’s just like the earth. It’s hottest in the middle. There’s
real fire there.” This smacks just a little perhaps of pedantry,
and the child, on entering the new world of school-lore, is, we
know, apt to display the pride of learning. Yet we must beware,
writes the ever-apologetic father, of judging the child’s
ways too rigorously by our grown-up standards.</p>

<p class='c001'>The progress in the more abstract kind of thinking and in
the correlative use of abstract language was very noticeable at
this stage. An odd example of an original way of expressing
a newly attained relation of thought occurred towards the end
of the third month. C. was at this time much occupied with
the subject of the bearing-rein, the cruelty of which he had learnt
from a favourite story, the autobiography of a horse, called
<cite>Black Beauty</cite>. One day when walking out, and, as was his
wont, vigilantly observant of all passing horses, he said:
“That horse has bearing-rein at all,” by which he seems to
have meant that the horse had it somewhere or wore it sometimes.
The use of expressions like these, which at once made
his statements more cautious and showed a better grasp of the
full sweep of a proposition, was very characteristic at this
period.</p>

<p class='c001'>Even now, however, he found himself sometimes compelled to
eke out his slender vocabulary by concrete and pictorial descriptions
of the abstract. Thus one day (end of eighth month) he
happened to overhear his father say that he should oppose a proposal
of a member of the Library Committee to which he belonged.
C., boy-like, interested in the prospect of a tussle, asked: "Who
is the greatest man, you or Mr. ——?" Asked by his father,
who imagined that the child was thinking of a physical contest
with the honourable gentleman, “Do you mean taller?”
he answered: “No. Who is most like a king?” In this
wise, observes the chronicler, did he try to express his new
idea of authority or influence over others.</p>

<p class='c001'>While he thus pushed his way into the tangle of abstract
ideas, he found himself now and again pulled up by a thorny
<span class='pageno' id='Page_484'>484</span>obstacle. Some of us can remember how when young we had
much trouble in learning to recognise the difference between the
right and the left hand. C. experienced the same difficulty. One
evening (towards the end of the eleventh month) after being put
to bed he complained of a sore spot on his foot. Being asked
on which foot, the right or the left, he said: “I can’t tell when
in bed. I can’t say when my clothes are off. I know my
right side by my pockets.” It would seem as if the differences
in the muscular and other sensations by help of which we come
to distinguish the one side of the body from the other are too
slight to be readily recognised, and that a clear intuition of this
simple and fundamental relation of position is the work of a
prolonged experience.<a id='r329' /><a href='#f329' class='c011'><sup>[329]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>By the end of the fourth month—a month after joining the
Kindergarten—he was able to count up to a century. His
interest in counting, which was particularly lively just now, is
illustrated in the fact that in the fifth month, after showing
himself very curious about the word ‘fortnight,’ saying again
and again that it was a funny word, and asking what it meant,
he put the question: “Does it mean fourteen nights?”</p>

<p class='c001'>About the same date he proffered a definition of one of the
most difficult of subjects. His mother had been trying to explain
the difference between poetry and prose by saying that
the former describes beautiful things, when he suddenly interrupted
her, exclaiming: “Oh yes, I know, it’s language
with ornaments”.  But here the diary has, it must be confessed,
the look of wishing to display the boy’s accomplishments, a
fault from which, on the whole, it is creditably free.</p>

<p class='c001'>As might be expected, the boy’s reasoning was now much
sounder, that is to say, more like our own. Yet now and again
<span class='pageno' id='Page_485'>485</span>the old easy fashion of induction would crop up. Thus one
day (towards end of ninth month) he was puzzled by the fact
that boys of the same age might be of unequal size. This
brought him to the old subject of growth, and he suggested
quite seriously that the taller boys had had more sun. On
his father saying: ‘The sun makes <em>plants</em> grow,’ he added:
“And people too”.</p>

<p class='c001'>His questionings took about this time the direction of
origins or beginnings. As with other children, God did not
appear to be the starting-point in the evolution of things,
and he once asked quite seriously (end of sixth month):
“What was God like in his younger days?” With a like impulse
to go back to absolute beginnings he inquired about the
same date, after learning that chicken-pox was only caught
from other animals: “What was the person or thing that first
had chicken-pox?” A little later (beginning of ninth month)
he and a boy companion of nearly the same age were talking
about the beginnings of human life. C. said “I can’t make
out how the first man in the world was able to speak. A word,
you know, has a sound, and how did he find out what sound
to make?” His friend then said that his puzzle was how the
first babies were nursed. This child seems to have set out
with the supposition that the history of our race began with
the arrival of babies.</p>

<p class='c001'>Very little is told us in this unfinished chapter of the child’s
emotional and moral development. As might be expected from
the increase of intellectual activity the movements expressive
of the feelings of strain and perplexity which accompany
thought grew more distinct. In particular it was noticeable at
this time that during the fits of thought the child’s face would
take on a quaint old-fashioned look, the eye-brows being
puckered up and the eye-lids twitching.</p>

<p class='c001'>He continued very sensitive about the cruelties of the world,
more especially towards animals. One day (at the end of the
fifth month) his mother had been reading to him his favourite,
<cite>Black Beauty</cite>, in which a war-horse describes to the equine
author the horrors of war. C. was deeply affected by the
picture, and at length exclaimed with much emphasis, “Oh,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_486'>486</span>ma! why do they do such things? It’s a <em>beastly</em>, <em>beastly</em>
world,” at the same time bursting into tears and hiding his face
in his mother’s lap. “So hard,” writes the father, “did the
boy still find it, notwithstanding his increased knowledge, to
accept this human world as a right and just one.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The religious thought and sentiment remained thoroughly
childish. He was still puzzled about the relations of heaven
and the grave. One day (end of sixth month) his father
observed, looking at the Christmas pudding on the table
wreathed with violet flame: “Oh, how I should like to be
burned after death instead of being buried”. On this C.
looking alarmed said: “<em>I</em> won’t be burned. I shouldn’t go to
heaven then.” On his father remarking: “’Tisn’t your body
that goes to heaven,” he continued: “But my <em>head</em> does”.
Here, writes the father, we seem to perceive a transition from
the old gross materialism of last year to a more refined form.
C. was now, it may be presumed, localising the soul in the
head, and clinging to the idea that at least that limited portion
of our frame might manage to get away from the dark grave to
the bright celestial regions. It may be too, he adds, that this
fancy was aided by seeing pictures of detached cherub heads.<a id='r330' /><a href='#f330' class='c011'><sup>[330]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>A month or two later (beginning of ninth month) he began
to attack the difficult problem of Divine fore-knowledge and
free-will. His mother had been remonstrating with him about
his naughty ways. He grew very miserable and said: “I
can’t make out how it is God doesn’t make us good. I pray to
him to make me good.” To this his mother replied that he
must help himself to be good. This only drew from C. the
following protest: “Then what’s the use of having God if
we have to help ourselves”. “Even now,” writes the father,
"it looks as if God and heaven were for him institutions, the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>raison d’être</i></span> of which was their serviceableness to man."</p>

<p class='c001'>He brought to the consideration of prayer a childish sense
of propriety which sometimes wore a quaint aspect. One day
(end of third month) on his return from the Kindergarten he
asked his mother: “Does God teach us?” and when bidden explain
his question continued: “Because they said that at school”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_487'>487</span>(“Teach us to be good”). He then added: “But anyhow
that isn’t a proper way to speak to God”. His notion of what
was the proper way was illustrated in his own practice. One
evening (end of sixth month) after his bath he was kneeling
with his head on his mother’s lap so that she might dry his
hair. He began to pray half audibly in this wise: “Please,
God, let me find out before my birthday, but at least on my
birthday.... So now good-bye!” This ending, obviously
borrowed from his sister’s letters, was varied on another
occasion in this way: “With my love, good-bye”.<a id='r331' /><a href='#f331' class='c011'><sup>[331]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It seems strange that the diary should break off at a time
when there was so much of the quaint and pretty child-traits
left to be observed. No explanation of the abrupt termination is
offered, and I am only able to conjecture that the father was at this
time pressed with other work, and that when he again found the
needed leisure he discovered to his chagrin that time, aided by the
school-drill, was already doing its work. We know that it is
about this time that the artist, Nature, is wont to rub out the
characteristic infantile lines in her first crude sketch of a human
mind, and to elaborate a fuller and maturer picture. And
while the onlooking parent may rejoice in the unfolding of the
higher human lineaments, he cannot altogether suppress a
pang at the disappearance of what was so delightfully fresh
and lovely.</p>

<p class='c001'>I will close these extracts, following the father’s own fashion,
with a word of apology. C.’s doings and sayings have seemed
to me worth recording, not because their author was in any
sense a remarkable child, but solely because he was a true
child. In spite of his habitual association with grown-up
people he retained with childish independence his own ways
of looking at things. No doubt something of the intellectual
fop, of the assertive prig, peeps out now and again. Yet
if we consider how much attention was given to his utterances,
this is not surprising. For the greater part the sayings
appear to me the direct naïve utterance of genuine childish
conviction. And it is possible that the inevitable impulse of
the parent to show off his child has done C. injustice by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>making too much, especially in the last chapter of the diary, of
what looks smart. Heaven grant that our observations of the
little ones may never destroy the delightful simplicity and
unconsciousness of their ways, and turn them into disagreeable
little performers, all conscious of their <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>rôle</i></span>, and greedy of admiration.</p>

the head appearing about the fifteenth month (<cite>First Three Years of
Childhood</cite>, Engl. transl., p. 21). Darwin finds that the sign of affirmation
(nodding) is less uniform among the different races of men
than that of negation. According to Preyer, while the gesture of
negation appears under the form of a turning away or declining
movement as an instinct in the first days of life, the accepting gesture
of nodding (which afterwards becomes the sign of affirmation) is
acquired and appears much later (see his full account of the growth
of these movements, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Die Seele des Kindes</cite></span>, p. 242).</p>

of all it is in part a reduplication like his later name ‘Kikkie’. Again,
we know that children often add the final <em>y</em> or <em>ie</em> sound, as in saying
‘dinnie’ for dinner, ‘beddie’ for bread. Once more, from the early
appearances of ‘ng’ sound in ‘ang,’ ‘ung,’ etc., we may infer it to
be easy. Indeed, one observer (Dr. Champneys) tells us that an

  <h2 class='c004'>XII. <br /> GEORGE SAND’S CHILDHOOD.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c017'><i>The First Years.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Much has been written about George Sand, but singularly
little about her childhood. Yet she herself, when she set to
work, between forty and fifty, to write the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Histoire de ma Vie</cite></span>,
thought it worth while to fill the best part of two volumes of
that work with early reminiscences; and herein surely she
judged wisely. Good descriptions of childish experience are rare
enough. George Sand gives us a singularly full story of childhood;
and, allowing for the fact of its author being a novelist,
one may say that this story reads on the whole like a record of
memory. That a narrative at once so charming and so pathetic
should have been neglected, by English writers at least, can
only be set down to the circumstance that it is not clearly
marked off from the tediously full account of ancestors which
precedes it.<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c011'><sup>[332]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The early reminiscences of a great man or woman have a
special interest. Schopenhauer has ingeniously traced out the
essential similarity of the man of genius and the child. Whatever
the value of this analogy, it is certain that the gifted child
seems not less but more of a child because of his gifts. This
is emphatically true of the little lady with whom we are now
concerned, and of whom, since we are interested in her on her
own account and not merely as the precursor of the great
novelist, we shall speak by her rightful name, Aurore Dupin.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>The reader need not be told that the child who was to become
the representative among modern women of the daring
irregularities of genius was an uncommon child. She would
certainly have been set down as strange and as deficient in
childish traits by a commonplace observer. Yet close inspection
shows that the untamed and untamable ‘oddities’ were,
after all, only certain common childish impulses and tendencies
exalted, or, if the reader prefers, exaggerated. Herein lies the
chief value of the story. To this it may be added that this
exaggeration of childish sensibility was set in a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>milieu</i></span> admirably
fitted to stir and strain it to the utmost. It was a motley
turbulent world into which little Aurore was unceremoniously
pitched, and makes the chronicle of her experience a thrilling
romance. And all this experience, it may be said finally, is
set down with the untroubled regard and the patient hand of
one of the old chroniclers. The forty years had left the memory
tenacious and clear to a remarkable degree—in this respect the
story will bear comparison with the childish recallings of
Goethe and the other famous self-historians; at the same time
these years had brought the woman’s power of quiet retrospect
and the artist’s habit of calm complacent envisagement.
Herein lies a further element of value. The writer feels her
identity with the subject of her memoir: she lives over again
the passion-storms and ennuis, the reveries and hoydenish
freaks of little Aurore; yet she can detach herself from her
heroine too, and discuss her and her surroundings with perfect
artistic aloofness.</p>

<p class='c001'>Aurore—or, to give her her full appellation, Amandine
Lucile Aurore Dupin—was born in 1804. Her father, a distinguished
officer of the Empire, was grandson of Maurice de
Saxe, natural son of Augustus II., King of Poland. Her
mother was a daughter of a Parisian bird-seller, and a true
child of the people. The student of heredity may, perhaps,
find in this commingling of noble and humble blood a key to
much of the wild and bizarre in the child as well as in the
later woman. However this may be, it is certain that the
disparate alliance gave the sombre and almost tragic hue to
the child’s destiny. Through the precious years that should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span>be given over to happy play and dreams, she was to hear the
harsh and dismal contention of classes, and hear it, too, in the
shape of a bawling strife for the possession of herself.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first home was a humble lodging in Paris. The father
was away. The mother, disdained by the father’s family, had
to be hard at work, and the baby had its irregular career foreshadowed
by being often handed over to a male nurse, one Pierret,
an ugly and quarrelsome though really good-natured creature,
whom an accident suddenly made a devoted friend of the small
family, faithfully dividing his time between the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>estaminet</i></span> and
the Dupin <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ménage</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Beyond a recollection of an accident, a fall against the
corner of the chimney-piece, which shock, she tells us, ‘opened
my mind to the sense of life,’ the first three years yield no reminiscences.
From that date onwards, however, her memory
moves without a hitch, and gives us a series of delightful
vignette-like pictures of child-life.</p>

<p class='c001'>Her mother had a fresh, sweet voice, and the first song she
sang to Aurore was the nursery rhyme:—</p>

<p class='c014'>I was vividly impressed [she writes] with that white hen and that
silver egg which was promised me every evening, and for which I
never thought of asking the next morning. The promise returned
always, and the naïve hope returned with it.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The legend of little Father Christmas, a good old man with
a white beard, who came down the chimney exactly at midnight
and placed a simple present, a red apple or an orange, in her
little shoe, excited the infantile imagination to unusual activity.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>Midnight, that fantastic hour which children know not, and which
we point out to them as the unattainable limit of their wakefulness!
What incredible efforts I made not to fall asleep before the appearance
of the little old man. 1 had at once a great desire and a great fear
to see him; but I could never keep awake.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The love of sound, so strong in children, found an outlet in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>playing with some brass wirework on the doors of an alcove
near her bed.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>My special amusement before going to sleep was to run my fingers
over the brass network. The little sounds that I drew thence seemed
to me a heavenly music, and I used to hear my mother say, “There’s
Aurore playing the <a id='corr492.6'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='wirework”'>wirework.”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_492.6'><ins class='correction' title='wirework”'>wirework.”</ins></a></span></p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Her vivid recollection enables her to describe with a sure
touch the oddly mixed and capriciously changeful feeling of
children towards their dolls and other simulacra of living creatures.
She somehow had presented to her a superb Punch, brilliant
with gold and scarlet, of whom she was greatly afraid at
first, on account of her doll. Before going to bed she securely
shut up this last in a cupboard, and laid the brilliant monster
on his back on the stove; but her anxieties were not yet over.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>I fell asleep very much preoccupied with the manner of existence
of this wicked being who was always laughing, and could pursue me
with his eyes into all the corners of the room. In the night I had
a frightful dream: Punch had got up, his hump had caught on fire
on the stove, and he ran about in all directions, chasing now me,
now my doll, which fled distractedly. Just as he was overtaking
us with long jets of flame, I awoke my mother with my cries.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Her childish way of looking at dolls is thus described in
another place:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>I do not remember to have ever believed that my doll was an
animated being; nevertheless, I have felt for some of my dolls a real
maternal affection.... Children are between the real and the impossible.
They need to care for, to scold, to caress, and to break
this fetish of a child or animal that is given them for a plaything,
and with which they are wrongly accused of growing disgusted too
quickly. It is quite natural, on the contrary, that they should grow
disgusted with them. In breaking them they protest against the
lie.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>She only broke those, she adds, that could not stand the
test of being undressed, or that proclaimed their unfleshly
substance by falling and breaking their noses. The fluctuations
of childish feeling in this matter, and the triumph of
faith over doubt in the case of a real favourite, are prettily
illustrated in a later story of how she parted from her doll
when she was going from home on a long journey.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_493'>493</span></div>
<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>At the moment of setting out I ran to give it a last look, and
when Pierret promised to come and make it take soup every morning,
I began to fall into a state of doubt, which children are wont to feel
respecting the reality of these creatures, a state truly singular, in
which nascent reason on one side and the need of illusion on the
other combat in their heart greedy of maternal love. I took the two
hands of my doll and joined them over its breast. Pierret remarked
that this was the attitude of a dead person. Thereupon I raised
the hands, still joined, above the head, in the attitude of despair or
of invocation. With this I associated a superstitious idea, thinking
that it was an appeal to the good fairy, and that the doll would be
protected, remaining in this position all the time of my absence.<a id='r333' /><a href='#f333' class='c011'><sup>[333]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The gift of vivid imagination is probably quite as much a
torment as a joy to a child, as the story of Punch suggests.
Aurore’s finely strung nervous organisation exposed her to a
preternatural intensity of fear, and made any clumsy attempt
to ‘frighten’ by suggestion of ‘black hole,’ or other childish
horror, more than ordinarily cruel. One day she had been
with her mother and Pierret on a visit to her aunt. On returning
towards the evening she was lazy and wanted the
amiable Pierret to carry her. So to spur her on her mother
threatened in fun to leave her alone if she did not come on.
The child knew it was not meant, and daringly stopped while
the others made a feint of moving on. It happened that a
little old woman was just then lighting a lamp hard by, and,
having overheard the talk, turned to the child and said in a
broken voice, ‘Beware of me; it is I who take up the wicked
little girls, and I shut them in my lamp all the night’.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>It seemed as if the devil had whispered to this good woman the
idea that would most terrify me. I do not remember ever experiencing
such a terror as she caused me. The lamp, with its glittering
reflector, instantly took on fantastic proportions, and I saw myself
already shut in this crystal prison consumed by the flame which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_494'>494</span>Punch in petticoats made to burst forth at her pleasure. I ran
towards my mother uttering piercing cries. I heard the old woman
laugh, and the grating sound of the lamp as she remounted gave me
a nervous shiver.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>At bottom Aurore’s nature was a happy one, and if it
encountered in the real world the terrors of childhood, it found
in the ideal world of fiction its supreme delights. Before she
learned to read (about four) she had managed to stock her
small brain with an odd jumble of supernatural imagery, the
outcome of fairy stories recited to her, and of picture-books
setting forth incidents from classical mythology and the lives
of the saints; and she soon began to make artistic use of this
motley material. Her mother, she tells us, used to shut her
within four straw chairs in order to keep her from playing with the
fire. She would then amuse herself by pulling out the straws
with her hands (she always felt the need of occupying her
hands) and composing in a loud voice interminable stories.
They were of course modelled on the familiar fairy-tale
pattern. The principal characters were a good fairy, a good
prince, and a beautiful princess. There were but few wicked
beings, and never great misfortunes. ‘All arranged itself
under the influence of a thought, smiling and optimistic as
childhood.’ These stories, carried on day after day, were the
subject of amusing comment. ‘Well, Aurore,’ the aunt used
to ask, ‘hasn’t your prince got out of the forest yet?’</p>

<p class='c001'>To Aurore’s ardent imagination, play, as the story of the
doll suggests, was more than the half-hearted make-believe
it often is with duller children. She was able to immerse
her whole consciousness in the scene, the occupation imagined,
so as to lose all account of her actual surroundings. One
evening, at dusk, she and her cousin were playing at chasing
one another from tree to tree, for which the bed-curtains did
duty. The room had disappeared for these little day-dreamers;
they were really in a gloomy country at the oncoming of night
and when they were called to dinner they heard nothing.
Aurore’s mother had finally to carry her to the table, and she
could ever after recall the astonishment she felt on seeing the
light, the table, and other real objects about her.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_495'>495</span>Even at this tender age the child came into contact with
the large mysterious outer world. At her aunt’s home at
Chaillot there was a garden, the one garden she knew, a small
square plot, seeming a vast region to Aurore, shut in by walls.
At the bottom of this garden, on a green terrace, she and her
cousin used to play at fighting battles.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>One day we were interrupted in our games by a great commotion
outside. There were cries of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘Vive l’Empereur!’</span> marchings with
quick step, and then retirings, the cries continuing all the while.
The emperor was, in fact, passing at some distance, and we heard
the tread of the horses and the emotion of the crowd. We could not
look over the walls, but the whole thing seemed very beautiful to my
fancy, and we cried with all our strength, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘Vive l’Empereur!’</span>
transported by a sympathetic enthusiasm.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>She first saw the Emperor in 1807, from the good Pierret’s
shoulders, where, being a conspicuous object, she attracted
Napoleon’s quick eye. ‘I was, as it were, magnetised for a
moment by that clear look, so hard for an instant, and suddenly
so benevolent and so sweet.’</p>

<p class='c001'>The political storm that was then raging on the sea of
Europe made itself felt even in the far-off and seemingly sheltered
creek of Aurore’s small life. Her father was aide-de-camp
to Murat at Madrid, and in 1808 the mother resolved to
betake herself to him with her child. It was a singular experience
for a girl just completing her fourth year, and the narrative
of it is romantic enough. Her imagination was strangely
affected by the sight of the great mountains, which seemed to
shut them in and to forbid their moving forwards or backwards.
Yet she felt no fear at the postillion’s malicious fictions about
brigands which quite horrified her mother. In Madrid they
found themselves quartered in a large and magnificent palace.
The unaccustomed space and splendour at first troubled the
child. She was tormented by the huge pictures from which
big heads seemed to come out and follow her, and she was
further alarmed by a low mirror which gave her the first sight
of her whole figure and made her feel how big she was.</p>

<p class='c001'>Murat was not over well pleased at the arrival of his aide-de-camp’s
wife and child, so an attempt was made to propitiate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_496'>496</span>him by decking the little maid in a gay and coquettish
uniform. The child, who was no coquette, seems to have
cared but little for this performance, though she soon began to
find amusement in her new sumptuous dwelling.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>As soon as I found myself alone in this large room I placed
myself before the low glass, and I tried some theatrical poses. Then
I took my white rabbit, and tried to force it to do likewise; or rather
I pretended to offer it as a sacrifice to the gods, using a footstool as
altar.... I had not the least feeling of coquetry; my pleasure
came from the make-believe that I was playing in a quartette scene
in which were two little girls and two rabbits. The rabbit and I
addressed, in pantomime, salutations, threats, and prayers to the
personages of the mirror, and we danced the bolero with them.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>It was at Madrid that she first made acquaintance with
one of Nature’s most fascinating mysteries, the echo.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>I studied this phenomenon with an extreme pleasure. What
struck me as most strange was to hear my own name repeated by
my own voice. Then there occurred to me an odd explanation. I
thought that I was double, and that there was round about me
another “I” whom I could not see, but who always saw me, since he
always answered me.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>She then combined with this strange phenomenon another,
<i>viz.</i>, the red and blue balls (ocular spectra) that she got into
her eyes after looking at the golden globe of a church glittering
against the sky, and so found her way to a theory that
everything had its double—a theory which, Mr. Tylor and
others tell us, was excogitated in very much the same way by
uncivilised man. She spent days in trying to get sight of her
double. Her mother, who one day surprised her in this search,
told her it was echo, ‘the voice in the air!’</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>This voice in the air no longer astonished me, but it still charmed
me. I was satisfied at being able to name it, and to call to it, ‘Echo,
are you there? Don’t you hear me? Good-day, Echo!’<a id='r334' /><a href='#f334' class='c011'><sup>[334]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The next event of deep import for Aurore was the sudden
death of her father by a fall from his horse, which occurred
in the autumn of the same year. The first visit of the King
of Terrors to a home has been a black landmark in many a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_497'>497</span>child’s life. Aurore was at first ‘annihilated’ by excess of
grief and fear, for, as she says, ‘childhood has not the strength
to suffer’. The days that immediately followed the bringing
in of the lifeless body were passed in a sort of stupor. Clear
recollection dates only from the moment when she was to be
clad in the conventional black.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>The black made a strong impression on me. I cried in submitting
to it; for though I had worn the black dress and veil of
the Spaniards, I had certainly never put on black stockings, and the
stockings frightened me terribly. I would have it that they were
putting on me the legs of death, and my mother had to show me
that she wore them also.<a id='r335' /><a href='#f335' class='c011'><sup>[335]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The father’s death brought a profound change into the
child’s life. The despised mother had already been recognised
by the paternal grandmother, and a certain advance made
towards a show of amity. Visits were paid to the grandmother’s
château at Nohant, and it was, in fact, when they
were staying there that the fatal accident occurred.</p>

<p class='c001'>The common loss drew the two women together for a time,
but the contrasts of temperament and of education were too
powerful, and the jealousy which had first directed itself to
the father now found a new object in his talented child. She
has given us more than one excellent description of mother
and grandmother. The latter, a blonde with white and red
complexion, imposing air, always dressed in a brown silk robe
and a white wig frizzled in front, was grave and quiet, ‘a veritable
Saxon,’ a friend of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>ancien régime</i></span>, a disciple of Voltaire
and Rousseau, albeit a stickler for the conventionalities of
high life. The mother was a brunette, of an ardent temperament,
endowed with considerable talent, yet timid and awkward
before grand folk, a Spanish nature, jealous and passionate, a
true democrat withal, and a worshipper of the Emperor. The
problem of dividing poor little Aurore between two such
women, habiting two distinct worlds, would have baffled Solomon
himself. The grandmother insisted on the advantages of
bringing up the child as a lady, and the mother, after a hard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_498'>498</span>struggle, relinquished her claims, the girl being handed over to
the grandmother and transported into the new world of Nohant.</p>

<p class='c001'>The story of this struggle, which tore the heart of Aurore
as much as that of her mother, is a tragedy of child-life. Aurore’s
instincts bound her to her mother. She implored her not to
give her up for money—she understood she was to be the
richer for the change. She was beside herself with joy when
her grandmother allowed her to visit the maternal home, and
she has given us a charming account of these visits. The
rooms were poor and ugly enough by the side of her grandmother’s
salons; yet—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>How good my mother seemed, how amiable my sister, how droll
and agreeable my friend Pierret! I could not stop repeating, ‘I am
here at home: down there I am at the house of my grandmother’.
‘Zounds!’ said Pierret; ‘don’t let her go and say <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>chez nous</i></span> before
Madame Dupin. She would reproach us with teaching her to talk
as they do <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>aux-z-halles</i></span>!’ And then Pierret would burst out into a
fit of laughter, for he was ready to laugh at anything, and my
mother made fun of him, and I cried out, ‘How we are enjoying
ourselves at home!’</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>When she found that she was to live at Nohant she was
beside herself with grief, and implored her mother to take her
away, and to let her join her in some business enterprise. The
mother seemed at first to yield to these entreaties; but the
barriers of rank proved to be inexorable, and would not let the
little orphan pass. The narrative of the final departure of the
mother from Nohant is deeply pathetic. It was the eve of the
parting: and the child resolved to write a letter to her mother
in which for the last time she poured out her passionate love
and her implorings to be taken with her. But the house was
sentinelled with hostile maids, and how to get the letter to its
destination? At last, lover-like, she bethought her of putting
it behind a portrait of her grandfather in her mother’s room.
To make sure of her finding it, she hung her nightcap on the
picture, writing on it in pencil ‘Shake the portrait!’ The
mother came, but a provoking maid stayed a long half-hour
with her. Aurore dared not move. Then, having waited another
half-hour for the maid to fall asleep, she crept to her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_499'>499</span>mother, whom she found reading the letter and weeping. She
pressed her child to her heart, but would listen to no more proposals
of flight from Nohant.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>I cried no more—I had no more tears; and I began to suffer
from a trouble more profound and lacerating than absence. I said
to myself, ‘My mother does not love me as much as I love her’.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>In the distraction of her grief she resolved that if it was unbearable
she would walk to Paris and rejoin her mother; and,
with characteristic inventiveness, thought out, by help of her
fairy stories, how she would avoid the anguish of begging by
disposing of some precious trinkets.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the grief, like many another that looks crushing at first,
proved not unbearable. In time the child learnt to take kindly
to her new home, and even to love the stately and severe-looking
grandmamma.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><i>The Grandmother’s Regime.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>It was verily a new home, this country house at Nohant.
Besides the grave grandmamma bent on drilling Aurore into the
proprieties, there was another solemn figure in Deschartres,
her friend and counsellor, who combined the functions of
steward of the estate and tutor of the young people. His pupils
were Aurore herself, a half-brother Hippolyte, whose birth
added one more irregularity to the family history, and of whom
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Histoire</cite></span> has much to say. Hippolyte was a wild-tempered
youth, more given to mischievous adventure and practical joking
than to serious study, and proved a considerable set-off to the
formal gravity of the elders of the household. A second youthful
companion was supplied in Clotilde, a girl of humble
parentage, who was probably introduced by the authorities as
a concession to Rousseau’s teaching, and supplied a link
between the young lady and the peasant world she was to love
and to portray. Beyond the house was the unpretending
country of Le Bas Berry, with its ‘landes’ or wastes, the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘Valée Noire’</span> of Aurore’s early descriptions, which more than
one of our writers have found half English in character, and
which was to become to Aurore what the Midlands were to
George Eliot.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_500'>500</span>The first effect of this forced separation from the mother
seems to have been to throw Aurore in upon herself, and to
confirm her natural tendency to reverie. She says much
at this stage of her day-dreaming, which overtook her both
when alone and when joining her companions in play. It
visited her regularly as she sat at her mother’s feet in the
evening listening to her reading, with an old screen covered
with green taffeta between her and the fire.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>I saw a little of the fire through this worn taffeta, and it formed
on it little stars, whose radiation I increased by blinking my eyes.
Then little by little I lost the meaning of the phrases which my
mother read. Her voice threw me into a kind of moral stupor, in
which it was impossible for me to follow an idea. Images began to
shape themselves before me, and came and settled on the green
screen. They were woods, meadows, rivers, towns of a grotesque
and gigantic architecture, as I have often seen them in dreams;
enchanted palaces with gardens like nothing that exists, with
thousands of birds of azure, gold, and purple, which sprang on the
flowers and let themselves be caught.... There were roses—green,
black, violet, and especially blue.<a id='r336' /><a href='#f336' class='c011'><sup>[336]</sup></a>... I closed my eyes and still
saw them, but when I reopened them I could only find them again
upon the screen.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>As at Madrid, so at Nohant: the splendour of her new
home caused her alarm at first. On the wall-paper of her bedroom
above each door was a large medallion with a figure: the
one a joyous dancing Flora; the other a grave, severe Bacchante,
standing with arm stretched out leaning on her thyrsus.
The first was beloved, the second dreaded. The child’s bed
was so placed that she had to turn her back on her favourite.
She hid her head under the bed-clothes and tried not to see that
terribly stern Bacchante, but in vain.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>In the middle of the night I saw it leave its medallion, glide along
the door, grow as big as a real person (as children say), and, walking
to the opposite door, try to snatch the pretty nymph from her niche.
She uttered piercing cries, but the Bacchante paid no heed to them.
She pulled and tore the paper till the nymph detached herself and
fled into the middle of the chamber. The other pursued her thither,
and as the poor fugitive threw herself on my bed in order to hide herself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_501'>501</span>under my curtain, the furious Bacchante came towards me and
pierced us both with her thyrsus, which had become a steeled lance,
whose every stroke was to me a wound of which I felt the pain.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>In her play with Ursule and Hippolyte she continued to
indulge in her passion for vivid imaginative realisation. When
playing at crossing the windings of a river, rudely marked with
chalk on the floor, five minutes would suffice to generate this
kind of hallucination.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>I lost all notion of reality, and believed I could see the trees,
the water, the rocks—a vast country—and the sky, now bright, now
laden with clouds which were about to burst and increase the danger
of crossing the river. In what a vast space children think they are
acting when they thus walk from table to bed, from the fireplace to
the door!</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>On one of these occasions, Hippolyte, with the boy’s bent
to realism, took the water jug, and pouring its contents on the
floor, produced a closer semblance of the river. The natural
consequence followed: the children, wholly absorbed in their
little drama, were caught by Aurore’s mother in the very act of
paddling with naked feet and legs in a dirty puddle formed by
the water and the staining of the floor, and were visited with
summary chastisement.</p>

<p class='c001'>More daring pranks would sometimes be ventured on with
Hippolyte. One day, as Deschartres was away shooting, the
boy got one of his works on Incantation, and tried, much in
the fashion of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, to get a
peep at the supernatural. Mysterious lines, digits, etc., were
duly traced on the floor with chalk, and other preparations
carried out. Then they awaited with deepening agitation the
first indication of success, the darting out of a blue flame on
certain digits or figures. Long minutes passed, yet no blue
flame, no devil’s horns, appeared to thrill the eager watchers.
At length Hippolyte, in order to keep up the girl’s excitement,
put his ear to the floor and declared that he could hear the
crackling sound of a flame. But it was all in vain. After all
it was but a game, ‘though a game that made our hearts
beat’.</p>

<p class='c001'>Hippolyte was given to dangerous experiments, which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_502'>502</span>dignified by high-sounding names. Thus he one day put
gunpowder into a big log and threw this into the fire, with
the view of blowing the saucepan into the kitchen, an occupation
which he cheerfully described as studying the theory of volcanoes.
He succeeded in leading on Aurore into pranks of a
decidedly hoydenish character, such as must have sadly
grieved the decorous grandmamma had she known of them.
They one day went so far as to dig a trough across the garden-path,
fill this with light wet earth, duly cover it with sticks
and leaves, and then watch Deschartres, who was particularly
vain of his white stockings, as with the stiff, pompous gait
of the pedagogue he marched straight into the trap.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such a child as Aurore, with her fits of reverie alternating
with somewhat rude outbursts of animal spirits, was not easily
drilled into those proprieties on which Madame Dupin set so
high a value. This good lady took great pains to make
Aurore walk properly, wear her gloves, give up the familiar
‘thou,’ and adopt the stilted mode of address of the fashionable
world. But she did not appreciate these educational experiments.
‘It seemed to me that she shut me in with herself in
a big box when she said to me, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Amusez-vous tranquillement”</span>.’
While, for the sake of pleasing her guardian, she outwardly
conformed to the rules of society, in her heart she remained a
rebel, and was dreadfully bored, when she ceased to be amused,
by her grandmother’s ‘old Countesses’. One exception to her
general dislike of the grand personages she had now to meet
was made in the case of her great-uncle, the Abbé of Beaumont.
He seems to have been a man of ability and culture, as well
as of amiable heart, and he proved a good friend of the family
after the death of Colonel Dupin by improvising the distraction
of a comedy at Nohant, in which Deschartres’ flute did duty as
orchestra, and the little Aurore was called on to dance a ballet
all by herself. The Abbé’s house, which was decorated throughout
in the style of Louis XIV., filled her with admiration, and
she loved to wander, candle in hand, alone through its vast
salons while the older people were absorbed in their cards.
This grand-uncle, by-the-bye, served in part as the prototype
of the Canon in <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><cite>Consuelo</cite></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_503'>503</span>The formal teaching was mostly handed over to Deschartres,
though the grandmother gave instruction in music. Aurore
can hardly be said to have been a backward child. She read
well at four. Towards five she learnt to write, but not having
patience to copy out the alphabet, struck out an original orthography
of her own, and indited letters in this to Ursule and
Hippolyte. It was, she tells us, very simple and full of
hieroglyphics. She devoured a certain class of books, and
found delight for five or six months in the stories of Madame
d’Aulnoy and of Perrault, which she came across at Nohant.
She adds that though she has never re-read them since, she
could repeat them all from beginning to end. She tried, out of
regard for her grandmamma, to take kindly to arithmetic, Latin,
and French versification, which Deschartres taught her, but
she could not master her dislike. After a little scene, in which
the passionate Deschartres threw a big dictionary at the girl’s
head, the Latin had to be given up altogether. The study
she liked best was history, since it gave her the chance of
indulging in the pleasures of imagination. She had to prepare
extracts from a book for her grandmother, and as she soon
found that these were not compared with the original, she
began to introduce additions of her own. Without altering
essential facts, she tells us, she would place the historical
personage in new imaginary situations, so as to develop the
character more completely. In truth, she seems to have used
history very much after the fashion which Aristotle, and after
him Lessing, recommend to the poets, varying the situation,
but leaving the character intact.</p>

<p class='c001'>In addition to these more solid studies, the young lady
had special lessons in dancing and in calligraphy. Both the
dancing-master and the writing-master came in for her ridicule.
The latter, she tells us, was</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>a professor of large pretensions, capable of spoiling the best hand
with his systems....  He had invented various instruments by
which he compelled his pupils to hold up the head, to keep the
elbow free, three fingers extended on the pen, and the little finger
stretched on the paper in such a way as to support the weight of the
hand.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_504'>504</span>It must have been a joyous moment for Aurore when she
was set free from the restraints and impositions of the château
for a couple of hours’ visit to some adjoining farm, where she
could shout, laugh, and romp with the peasant girls. Here
she would climb the trees, rush wildly down from the top to
the bottom of a mountain of sheaves in the barn, and do other
outrageous things; or when the dream-mood was on her she
would quietly contemplate her rustic friends as they tended
the lambs, hunted for eggs, or gathered fruit from the
orchard, weaving their figures into one of her interminable
romances.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among the charming rural pictures that her pen has drawn
for us in these recollections there is one of a swineherd, called
Plaisir, for whom she conceived a strange friendship. She
loved to watch his odd figure, always clothed in a blouse and
hemp trousers, ‘which with his hands and naked feet had taken
the colour and the hardness of the earth,’ armed with a triangular
iron instrument, ‘the sceptre of swineherds,’ and looking
like ‘a gnome of the glebe, a kind of devil between man and
werwolf’. As the swine turned up the soil with their snouts,
the birds would come to forage.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>Sometimes these birds perched on the hog merely to get warm,
or in order the better to observe the labour from which they were
to profit. I have often seen an old ashy rook balancing himself
there on one leg with a pensive and melancholy air, while the hog
bored deeply in the soil, and by these labours caused it oscillations
which disturbed it, rendered it impatient, and finally drove it to
correct this clumsiness by strokes of its beak.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Nor was it merely as playmates that the young lady from
the château deigned to associate with the peasantry. She
threw herself with ardent sympathy into the hard toilsome life
of the people. One day, as she chanced to see an old
woman stooping, as well as her stiff limbs allowed her, to
gather sticks in her grandmother’s garden, she set vigorously
to work with bill-hook cutting dry wood, working late into the
evening, and forgetting all about her meal, for she was ‘strong
as a peasant girl’. She then set out with blood-stained face
and hands, and with a weight greater than that of her own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_505'>505</span>body, for the poor woman’s hut, where she enjoyed a well-earned
slice from her black loaf.</p>

<p class='c001'>This contact with the rustic mind, so oddly introduced into
the fashionable scheme of education, exerted a profound effect
on the child’s imagination. She listened eagerly to the superstitious
stories which the hemp-dressers related when they
came to crush the hemp, sitting in the moonlight within view
of the crosses of a cemetery. Among these were a sacristan’s
gruesome stories of interments and of the rats that lived in the
belfry. The doings of those rats, she tells us, would of themselves
fill a volume. He knew them all, and had given them
the names of the more important among the deceased villagers.
They were very clever, and could, among other exploits, arrange
grains or beans given them in the form of a circle enclosing a
cross. It is hardly surprising to learn that these stories robbed
Aurore of her sleep.</p>

<p class='c001'>The rustic legend of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>grande bête</i></span> much exercised the
girl’s brain. She tried to reconcile the superstition with what
she had learnt about the animal kingdom. And in this way
she concluded that the creature must be a member of a species
almost entirely extinct. She imagined that it was leading a
solitary existence, being able to survive the rest of its species
by hiding during the day and wandering at night. This weird
conception soon began to expand into a zoological romance.</p>

<p class='c001'>If the girl’s imaginative impulse had been excited by her
historical studies, it could not but be roused to preternatural
activity by the stirring political events of the time. In 1812,
when she was just eight years old, occurred Napoleon’s disastrous
invasion of Russia. The absence of all news of the
army for fifteen days gave a new direction to her reverie.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>I imagined that I possessed wings, that I darted through space,
and that peering into the abysses of the horizon I discovered the
vast snows and the endless steppes of White Russia. I hovered,
took my bearings in the air, and at last spied the wandering columns
of our unhappy legions. I guided them towards France—for that
which tormented me the most was that they did not know where
they were, and that they were moving towards Asia, plunging more
and more into deserts as they turned their backs on the West.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_506'>506</span>A quaint illustration of the conflict the child’s mind was
passing through under the contradictory impressions of
Napoleon’s character received from her mother and from her
new instructors at Nohant, is given us in the following:—</p>

<p class='c001'>Once I dreamt I carried him (the Emperor) through space and
set him on the cupola of the Tuileries. There I had a long talk
with him, put him a thousand questions, and said to him, ‘If thou
prove thyself by thy answers, as people say, a monster, an ambitious
man, a drinker of blood, I will cast thee down and dash thee to pieces
on the threshold of thy palace; but if thou justify thyself, if thou
be what I have believed, the good, the great, the just Emperor, the
father of the French, I will replace thee on thy throne, and with my
sword of fire defend thee from thy enemies’. He thereupon opened
his heart and confessed that he had committed many faults from
too great a love of glory, but he swore that he loved France, and
that henceforth he would only think of the happiness of the people.
On this I touched him with my sword of fire, which rendered him
invulnerable.</p>

<h3 class='c017'><i>A Self-evolved Religion.</i></h3>

<p class='c014'>Perhaps there is no domain of children’s thought and feeling
that is more remote from our older experience, and consequently
less easily understood by us, than that of religion.
Their first ideas about the supernatural are indeed, as we have
seen above, though supplied by us, not controlled by us.</p>

<p class='c001'>To most children, presumably, religious instruction comes—at
first at least—with a commanding, authoritative force. The
story of the supernatural, of the Divine Father, of Heaven,
and the rest, cannot be scrutinised by the child—save, indeed,
in respect of its inner consistency—for it tells of things unobservable
by sense, and so having no direct contact with
childish experience. Their natural tendency is to believe, in
a submissive, childish way, not troubling about the proof of
the mystery.</p>

<p class='c001'>But even in this submissive acceptance there lies the germ
of a subsequent transformation. If the child is to believe, he
must believe in his own fashion; he must give body and reality
to the ideas of Divine majesty and goodness, and of spiritual
approach and worship. Hence the way in which children are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_507'>507</span>apt to startle the reverent and amuse the profane by divulging
their crude material fancies about things spiritual.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such materialisation of spiritual conceptions is apt to
bring trouble to the young mind. It is all so confusing—this
exalted Personage, who nevertheless is quite unlike earthly
dignitaries, this all-encompassing and never-failing Presence,
which all the time refuses to reveal itself to eye or ear. How
much real suffering this may entail in the case of children at
once serious and imaginative we shall never know. The description
of the boy Waldo, in that strangely fascinating book,
<cite>The Story of an African Farm</cite>, kneeling bare-headed in the
blazing sun and offering his dinner on an altar to God, may
look exaggerated to some; but it is essentially true to some of
the deepest instincts of childhood. The child that believes at
all, believes intensely, and his belief grows all-commanding and
prolific of action.</p>

<p class='c001'>While, however, it is the common tendency of children
passively to adopt their elders’ religious beliefs, merely inventing
their own modes of giving effect to them, there is a certain
amount of originality exercised in the formation of the beliefs
themselves. Stories of independent creations of a religious
cult by children are no doubt rare; and this for the very good
reason that it needs the greatest force of self-assertion to resist
the pressure of the traditional faith on the childish mind. The
early recollections of George Sand furnish what is probably
the most remarkable instance of childish daring in fashioning
a new religion, with its creed and ritual all complete.</p>

<p class='c001'>Poor little Aurore’s religious difficulties and experiments at
solution can only be understood in the light of her confusing
surroundings. From her mother—ardent, imaginative, and of
a ‘simple and confiding faith’—she had caught some of the
glow of a fervent piety. Then she suddenly passed into the
chilling air of Nohant, where the grandmother equalled her
master Voltaire in cynical contempt of the revered mysteries.
The effect of this sudden change of temperature on the
warm young heart was, as might have been anticipated, extremely
painful. Madame Dupin at once recognised the girl’s
temperament, and saw with dismay the leaning to ‘superstition,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_508'>508</span>a trait which she disliked none the less for recognising
in it a bequest from the despised <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>grisette</i></span> mother. So
she applied herself with all the energy of her strong character
to counteract the child’s religious tendencies. Now
this might have proved neither a difficult nor lengthy process
if she had consistently set her face against all religious
observances. But though a disciple of Voltaire, she was also
a lady with a conspicuous social position, and had to make
her account with the polite world and the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>‘bienséances’</i></span>. So
Aurore was not only allowed but encouraged to attend Mass
and to prepare for the ‘First Communion’ like other young
ladies of her station. Madame Dupin well knew the risk she
was running with so inflammable a material, but she counted
on her own sufficiency as a prompt extinguisher of any inconveniently
attaching spark of devotion. In this way the young girl
underwent the uncommon if not unique experience of a regular
religious instruction, and, concurrently with this and from the
very hand that had imposed it, a severe training in rational
scepticism and contempt for the faith of the vulgar.</p>

<p class='c001'>Even if Aurore had not been in her inmost heart something
of a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>dévote</i></span>, this parallel discipline in outward conformity and
inward ridicule would have been hurtful enough. As it was, it
brought into her young life all the pain of contradiction, all the
bitterness of enforced rebellion.</p>

<p class='c001'>The attendance on Mass could hardly have seemed dangerous
to Madame Dupin. The old <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>curé</i></span> of Nohant was not troubled
with an excess of reverence. When ordering a procession, in
deference to the mandate of his archbishop, he would seize the
occasion for expressing his contempt for such mummeries. In
his congregation there was a queer old lady, who used to utter
her disapproval of the ceremony with a frankness that would
have seemed brutal even in a theatre, by exclaiming, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘Quelle
diable de Messe!’</span> And the object of this criticism, on turning
to the congregation to wind up with the familiar <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Dominus
vobiscum</i></span>, would reply in an under-tone, yet loudly enough for
Aurore’s ear, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘Allez au diable!’</span> That the child attached little
solemnity to the ritual is evident from her account to the
grandmother of her first visit to the Mass: ‘I saw the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>curé</i></span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_509'>509</span>who took his breakfast standing up before a big table, and
turned round on us now and then to call us names’.</p>

<p class='c001'>The preparation for the ‘First Communion’ was a more
serious matter. The girl had now to study the life of Christ,
and her heart was touched by the story. ‘The Gospel (she
writes) and the divine drama of the life and death of Jesus
drew from me in secret torrents of tears.’ Her grandmother,
by making now and again ‘a short, dry appeal to her reason,’
succeeded in getting her to reject the notion of miracles and of
the divinity of Jesus. But though she was thus unable to
reach ‘full faith,’ she resolved <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>en revanche</i></span> to deny nothing
internally. Accordingly she learnt her catechism ‘like a parrot,
without seeking to understand it, and without thinking of
making fun of its mysteries’. For the rest, she felt a special
repugnance towards the confessional. She was able to recall
a few small childish faults, such as telling a lie to her mother
in order to screen the maid Rose, but feared the list would not
satisfy the confessor. Happily, however, he proved to be more
lenient than she had anticipated, and dismissed his young
penitent with a nominal penance.</p>

<p class='c001'>The day that makes an epoch in the Catholic girl’s life at
length arrived, and Aurore was decked out like the rest of the
candidates. The grandmother, having given a finishing touch
to her instructions by bidding Aurore, while going through the
act of decorum with the utmost decency, ‘not to outrage
Divine wisdom and human reason to such an extent as to
believe that she was going to eat her Creator,’ accompanied
her to the church. It was a hard ordeal. The incongruous
appearance of the deistic grandmamma in the place sufficed in
itself to throw the girl’s thoughts into disorder. She felt the
hollowness of the whole thing, and asked herself whether she
and her grandmother were not committing an act of hypocrisy.
More than once her repugnance reached such a pitch that she
thought of getting up and saying to her grandmother, ‘Enough
of this: let us go away’. But relief came in another shape.
Going over the scene of the ‘Last Supper’ in her thoughts,
she all at once recognised that the words of Jesus, ‘This is
my body and my blood,’ were nothing but a metaphor. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_510'>510</span>was too holy and too great to have wished to deceive his
disciples. This discovery of the symbolism of the rite calmed
her by removing all feeling of its grotesqueness. She left the
Communion table quite at peace. Her contentment gave a
new expression to her face, which did not escape the anxious
eyes of Madame Dupin: ‘Softened and terrified, divided
between the fear of having made me devout and that of having
caused me to lie to myself, she pressed me gently to her heart
and dropped some tears on my veil’.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was out of this conflicting and agitating experience, the
full sense of the beauty of the Christian faith and the equally
full comprehension of the sceptic’s destructive logic, that there
was born in Aurore’s imagination the idea of a new private
religion with which nobody else should meddle. She gives us
the origin of this strange conception clearly enough:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>Since all religion is a fiction (I thought), let us make a story
which may be a religion, or a religion which may be a story. I don’t
believe in my stories, but they give me just as much happiness as
though I did.<a id='r337' /><a href='#f337' class='c011'><sup>[337]</sup></a> Besides, should I chance to believe in them from
time to time, nobody will know it, nobody will dispel my illusion by
proving to me that I am dreaming.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The form and the name of her new divinity came to her in
a dream. He was to be called ‘Corambé’. His attributes
must be given in her own words:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>He was pure and charitable as Jesus, radiant and beautiful as
Gabriel; but it was needful to add a little of the grace of the
nymphs and of the poetry of Orpheus. Accordingly he had a less
austere form than the God of the Christian, and a more spiritual
feeling than those of Homer. And then I was obliged to complete
him by investing him on occasion with the guise of a woman, for
that which I had up to this time loved the best, and understood the
best, was a woman—my mother. And so it was often under the
semblance of a woman that he appeared to me. In short, he had
no sex, and assumed all sorts of aspects.... Corambé should have
all the attributes of physical and moral beauty, the gift of eloquence,
the omnipotent charm of the arts—above all, the magic of musical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_511'>511</span>improvisation. I wished to love him as a friend, as a sister, while
revering him as a God. I would not be afraid of him, and to this
end I desired that he should have some of our errors and weaknesses.
I sought that one which could be reconciled with his perfection,
and I found it in an excess of indulgence and kindness.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>The religious idea took an historical form, and Aurore proceeded
to develop the several phases of Corambé’s mundane
existence in a series of sacred books or songs. She supposed
that she must have composed not less than a thousand of
such songs without ever being tempted to write down a line
of them. In each of these the deity Corambé, who had become
human on touching the earth, was brought into a fresh
group of persons. These were all good people; for although
there existed wicked ones, one did not see them, but only knew
of them by the effects of their malice and madness. Corambé
always appears, like Jesus—and one may add, like Buddha—as
the beneficent one, spending himself, and suffering persecutions
and martyrdom, in the cause of humanity.</p>

<p class='c001'>This occupation of the imagination developed ‘a kind of
gentle hallucination’. Aurore soon learned to betake herself
to her hero-divinity for comfort and delight. Even when her
peasant companions chattered around her she was able to lose
herself in her world of religious romance.</p>

<p class='c001'>The idea of sacred books was followed by that of a temple
and a ritual. For this purpose she chose a little wood in her
grandmother’s garden, a perfect thicket of young trees and
undergrowth, into which nobody ever penetrated, and which,
during the season of leaves, was proof against any spying eye.
Here, in a tiny, natural chamber of green, carpeted with a magnificent
moss, she proceeded to erect an altar against a tree stem,
decking it with shells and other ornaments and crowning it
with a wreath of flowers suspended from a branch above.
The little priestess, having made her temple, sat down on the
moss to consider the question of sacrifices.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>To kill animals, or even insects, in order to please him, appeared
to me barbarous and unworthy of his ideal kindliness. I persuaded
myself to do just the opposite—that is, to restore life and liberty on
his altar to all the creatures that I could procure.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_512'>512</span>Her offering included butterflies, lizards, little green frogs,
and birds. These she would put into a box, lay it on the
altar, and then open it, ‘after having invoked the good genius
of liberty and protection’.</p>

<p class='c001'>In these mimic rites, hardly removed from genuine childish
play, the doubt-agitated girl found repose: ‘I had then delicious
reveries, and while seeking the marvellous, which had
for me so great an attraction, I began to find the vague idea
and the pure feeling of a religion according to my heart’.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the sweet sanctuary did not long remain inviolate.
One day her boy playmate came to look for her, and tracked
her to her secret grove. He was awe-struck at the sight, and
exclaimed: ‘Ah, miss, the pretty little altar of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Fête-Dieu</i></span>!’
He was for embellishing it still further, but she felt the charm
was destroyed.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>From the instant that other feet than mine had trodden his
sanctuary, Corambé ceased to dwell in it. The dryads and the
cherubim deserted it, and it seemed to me as if my ceremonies and
my sacrifices were from this time only childishness, that I had not
in truth been in earnest. I destroyed the temple with as much care
as I had built it; I dug a hole at the foot of the tree, where I buried
the garlands, the shells, and all the rustic ornaments, under the
ruins of the altar.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>This story of Aurore’s religious experiment cannot fail to
remind the reader of biography of the child Goethe’s well-known
essays in the same direction. The boy’s mind, it will
be remembered, had been greatly exercised with the religious
problem, first of all under the impression of horror caused by
the earthquake at Lisbon, and later from having to listen to
accounts of the new sects—Separatists, Moravians, and the
rest—who sought a closer communion with the deity than was
possible through the somewhat cold ritual of the established
religion. Stirred by their example, he tried also to realise a
closer approach to the Divine Being. He conceived him, he
tells us, as standing in immediate connexion with Nature.
So he invented a form of worship in which natural products
were to represent the world, and a flame burning over these
to symbolise the aspirations of man’s heart. A handsome
<span class='pageno' id='Page_513'>513</span>pyramid-shaped music-stand was chosen for altar, and on the
shelves of this the successive stages in the evolution of Nature
were to be indicated. The rite was to be carried out at sunrise,
the altar-flame to be secured by means of fumigating
pastils and a burning-glass. The first performance was a
success, but in trying to repeat it the boy-priest omitted to put
the pastils into a cup, so the lacquered stand, with its beautiful
gold flowers, was disastrously burnt—a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>contretemps</i></span> which
took away all spirit for new offerings.</p>

<p class='c001'>In comparing these two instances of childish worship, one
is struck perhaps more by their contrast than by their similarity.
Each of the two incidents illustrates, no doubt, a true
childish aspiration towards the great Unseen, and also an
impulse to invent a form of worship which should harmonise
with and express the little worshipper’s individual
thoughts. But here the resemblance ceases. The boy-priest
felt, apparently, nothing of the human side of religion: he
was the true precursor of Goethe, the large-eyed man of science
and the poet of pantheism, and found his delight in symbolising
the orderliness of Nature’s work as a whole, and its Divine
purpose and control. Aurore Dupin, on the other hand,
approached religion on the human and emotional side, the
side which seems more appropriate to her sex. She thought of
her deity as intently occupied with humanity and its humble
kinsfolk in the sentient world; and she endowed him above all
other qualities with generosity and pitifulness, even to excess.
Goethe seems to represent the speculative, Aurore the humanitarian,
element in the religious impulse of the child.</p>

<p class='c001'>To follow Aurore into her later religious experiences in the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">‘Couvent des Anglaises’</span> would be clearly to go beyond the
limits of these studies of childhood. I hope I may have quoted
enough from the first chapters of the autobiography to illustrate
not only their deep human and literary interest, but their special
value to the psychological student.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
